Conduct of business of the Government of a State,- (1) All executive action of the Government of a State shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor.
The protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise.
In any event, the retrospective withdrawal of the benefit on the basis of an executive decision is impermissible.
Though the appellants were not entitled to any opportunity of hearing before alteration of the benefits flowing from the notifications or withdrawal of any benefit, yet when the State has not taken any specific stand justifying the withdrawal and the High Court referred to the files to put its seal of proof, notwithstanding non-requirement for granting any opportunity before the withdrawal, principles of natural justice certainly were applicable, since the High Court with reference to the files recorded findings on the basis thereof.
The doctrine of promissory estoppel had no application to the facts of the case at that stage.
So far as legitimate expectation aspect is concerned, it is too well known that the benefit extended can be withdrawn and with this knowledge if the units are set up, the principle of legitimate expectation does not apply.
24.  The question of legitimate expectation arises according to the appellants after the benefits were granted by the concerned G.O.Ms.
