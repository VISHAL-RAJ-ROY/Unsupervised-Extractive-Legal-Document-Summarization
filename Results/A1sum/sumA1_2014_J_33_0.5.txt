Nos.7122 of 2003, 7123-7124 of 2003, 7125 of 2003 and 7126-7129 of 2003 relevant factual matrix of the case is as follows: After giving credit of Rs.4.33 crores payable by the State Government on account of amounts towards compensation for acquisition of land, the liability of the Company was determined at Rs.6.09 crores on 20th February, 1992.
6172-6174 of 2013, C.A.No.7122 of 2003, C.A.Nos.7123-7124 of 2003, C.A.No.7125 of 2003 are allowed in terms of the directions as above.
A piece of land of the Company was put to auction for recovery of dues of the Company.
Till 28th November, 1984, the Company was the owner of the units/Sugar Mill.
In a situation like in the present case, one cannot hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest, in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the Court of law.
The aforesaid orders were also challenged by the State Government.
The Company moved an application before the District Collector, Meerut stating therein that as on date there are no arrears/liability payable by the Company, therefore, requested to remove the Receiver. 15.
The aforesaid judgment and orders are under challenge in C.A. Nos.7122 of 2003, 7123-7124 of 2003, 7125 of 2003 and 7126-7129 of 2003.
The authority while so determining shall take into consideration the liability of the Company as on 28th October, 1984, including labour charges, Sales Tax, loan amount given by the State Government etc.
M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd.) have been preferred by the Commissioner, Meerut Division, Meerut.
The aforesaid orders have been challenged in C.A. No.7122 of 2003 (M/s. Rudra Estate Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
By order dated 12th October, 1995, the Appellate Tribunal directed the appellant to file a fresh deduction claim before the prescribed authority.
But for the reasons mentioned by the High Court the sale has been cancelled.
The writ petitions were disposed of by the learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court by a common judgment dated 1st March, 2011.
The State Government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under U.P. Sugar Undertaking (Acquisition) Act, 1971.
A separate counter affidavit was filed by the Deputy Secretary, Sugar and Cane Development, Lucknow, giving details of dues payable by the Company as detailed by the District Collector, Meerut by his order dated 18th December, 1995.
The High Court by the impugned judgment dated 1st March, 2011, though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the Collector, Tulsi Gaur by order dated 20th February, 1992 held that there were dues of about Rs.10.44 crores payable by the Company, part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the Meerut Development Authority, even thereafter an amount of Rs.6.09 crores will remain payable by the Company, but the High Court failed to address such issue.
Writ Petition No.16451 of 1999 before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad challenging the sale proclamation dated 28th March, 1992, order dated 30th May, 1992 passed by Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Meerut confirming the sale of the properties owned by the Company and the order dated 5th April, 1999 passed by the Commissioner, Meerut Division, Meerut whereby the objections filed by the Company under Rule 285-1 of the Rules framed under U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act (hereinafter referred to as the "Land Reforms Act") was rejected.
Payments so made shall be subject to final decision of the Writ Petition.
The order of the extension of tenure of the Receiver was challenged by the ex- proprietors of the Company in a Writ Petition No.18496/1991.
The District Collector, Meerut by order dated 18th December, 1995, allowed the case No.30/1995 with observation that as on the date no recovery certificate was pending against the Company.
According to the appellant, the aforesaid issue has not been decided.
The High Court initially passed an interim order on 17th July, 1997 as under: "Considering the facts and the circumstances of the case, the respondents are directed to pay to M/s Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd., Meerut the amount of compensation money amounting to Rs.4,33,94,783.40 after deducting a sum of Rs.1,62,02,402.20 + interest and collection charges within a period of two months from today.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
By the said judgment, the High Court directed the State Government to pay the Company the compensation on the basis of the compromise reached between the State Government and the tenure holder Company for acquisition of their land by Meerut Development Authority.
The learned counsel for the petitioners invites our attention to the Order dated 20.10.2002 (page 94C of the Paper Book).
(M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. vs The Colletor/District Magistrate & Ors.).
Against the aforesaid order dated 3rd August, 1996 passed by the Chairman, Board of Revenue, the Company filed Writ Petition No.31378/1996 on the ground that there is no dues payable by the Company.
We find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.
The matter is remitted to the District Collector, Meerut to determine the liability of the Company upto the date of vesting i.e. 28th October, 1984 after notice to the parties.
The District Collector, Meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of Rs.1.62 crores as on 24th October, 1990 were to be paid by the Company, extended the tenure of the Receiver till further orders.
Though the inevitable conclusion is that the High Court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the Act, yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
In the said case the U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd. filed a counter affidavit refuting such stand taken by the Company.
In these appeals the dispute relates to payment of compensation pursuant to acquisition of land of respondent-M/s.
The grievance of the appellant-State is that the High Court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the Company.
The appeals (C.A.Nos.7126-7129 of 2003) filed by the Commissioner, Meerut are dismissed.
C.A. Nos.
Taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities, it would, therefore, be appropriate to direct the State to pay interest at the rate of 6% on the amount to be refunded as per the High Court's order with effect from 27th April, 2001 and 3rd September, 2001, the day, the High Court passed the impugned order.
It has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.
In the present case, we find that there was no mis-representation on the part of the auction purchasers; they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.
This direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1-4- 2000.
It would, therefore, be appropriate if the appellants pay interest @ 6% from 1-4-2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
