They are: (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.
On the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R., investigation was taken up initially by P.W.40.
That apart, C.W.1 has stated that no statement has been made in his presence.
The scope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this Court.  However, in almost all such decisions reference is made to the observation of the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kotayya v. Emperor (AIR 1947 PC 67 1946 Indlaw PC 23).

Information supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does not lead to the discovery of the knife; knives were discovered many years ago.
Apart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession, in view of statement under Section 164 of the Code of P.W.22 and the statement of C.W.1, a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of C.W.1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported.
No witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence.

While testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused.
If the accused had not made such a statement at such first instance, when he had confessed about other articles, it is not understood as to how after 5 months when he was on bail he would make such a statement.
(See Hukam Singh v. State of Rajasthan AIR (1977 SC 1063 1977 Indlaw SC 433); Eradu and Ors.
