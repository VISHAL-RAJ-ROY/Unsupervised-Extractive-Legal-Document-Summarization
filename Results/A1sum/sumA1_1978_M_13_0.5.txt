It is, therefore, not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act to the effect that a particular Jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant, especially ,when having regard to the definition given in section 2(xviii) a Jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products.
Turning to the other specific question raised by counsel for the respondent before us we are clearly of the view that in the facts and circumstances of the case the inquiry initiated by the Collector under s.37(4) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code will have to be regarded as incompetent, misconceived and uncalled for.
Thereupon a notice under section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code for the purpose of holding an inquiry into the rights of the respondent to mines and mineral products of the said villages claimed by the respondent wag served upon him but the respondent raised a preliminary objection that such inquiry wag misconceived and incompetent in view of the determination made under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the provisions of section 10 of the Act- his rights, to mines and mineral products were expressly saved; the Collector of Sabarkantha (appellant No. 2) overruled the preliminary objection and by order dated February 23, 1973, directed that the inquiry shall proceed and the respondent was directed to produce his evidence in support of his claim on a date that would be fixed and intimated to him.
We may state that Counsel for- the respondent categorically stated before the Court that his client was confining his right to excavating only one type of mineral product, namely, gravel and stones, and that too from only two villages, namely, Kapoda and Isarwada comprised in his Jagir, in regard to which the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24, 1959, was quite clear and, therefore, he urged that the further inquiry under section 37(2) of the Code into that very right was misconceived and uncalled for.
The main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of State, of Gujarat, and the Collector of Sabarkantha against the Gujarat High Court's judgment and order dated January 30/31, 1975 allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under section 2(4) (i) of the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act, 1953 (Bombay Act No. XXXIX of 1954) declares that a particular Jagir is a proprietary one, a further inquiry under section 37 (2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code (Bombay Act No. V of 1879) with a view to determining whether the Jagirdar had any rights to mines or mineral products in his Jagir granted or recognised under any contract, grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage is competent? 2.
In other words, the competent authority holding an inquiry under section 2(4) (i) can come to the conclusion that a particular Jagir is proprietary if it finds that the Jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products.
section 2(4), though it forms part of a definition section, contains a substantive provision which is material for our purposes and it runs thus: "2(4) If any question arises,- (i) whether a jagir is proprietary or non- proprietary, (ii)whether any land is Ghatked or Jiwai, or (iii)whetherany person is a permanent holder, the State Government shall decide the question and such decision shall be final: Provided that the State Government may authorise any officer to decide questions arising under any of the subclauses(i), (ii) and (iii) and subject to 'an appeal to the State Government, his decision shall 'be final?" 9. Section 3, which contains the main provision dealing with abolition of jagirs, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any usage, grant, sanad, order, agreement or any law for the time being in force, on and from the appointed date (which under section 2 (1) (i) is a date on which the Act comes into force, which is August 1, 1954), all jagirs shall be deemed to have been abolished and save as expressly provided by or under the provisions of this Act, the right of a jagirdar to recover rent or assessment of land or to levy or recover any kind of tax, cess, fee, charge or any hak and the right of reversion or lapse if any, vested in a jagirdar, and all other rights of a jagirdar or of any person legally subsisting on the said date-, in respect of a jagir village as incidents of jagir shall be deemed to have been extinguished.
2(4)(i) and clearly show that the determination of the question whether a Jagir is proprietary or nonproprietary does not necessarily involve the determination of the question whether the Jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date.
According to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent's Jagir was found under section 2(4) (i) to be proprietary was not tantamount to the establishment by the respondent of his rights to mines and mineral products in the villages of his Jagir for which there must be an actual grant or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the Collector by holding an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, and, therefore the High Court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the inquiry initiated by the second appellant under section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, was incompetent or without jurisdiction.
In other words, our answer to the general question raised above would be that even after the competent authority has declared a particular Jagir to be a proprietary one under section 2(4) (i) of the Act, a further inquiry under section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue Code into the question whether a Jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the Jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and mineral products ,or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to ,be the basis of the, determination under section 2 (4) (1 ) of the Act.
a non-proprietary Jagir the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of Jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under section 11 (1), while in the case of a proprietary Jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the Jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land; section 11(3) provides for compensation and computation thereof to a Jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in section 8.
section 2(xv) defines "nonproprietary Jagir" as meaning a jagir which consists of a right in the jagirdar to appropriate as incident of the jagir, land revenue or rent due to Government from persons holding land in a jagir village, but which does not consist of any right or interest in the soil.
According to the respondent since the entries made in the revenue records in respect of his rights to mines and mineral products were not sufficient and proper and though the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24, 1959 was in respect of two villages, namely, Kapoda and Isarwada, the relevant entry in respect of greval and stones had been made only in regard to village Kapoda, he by his application dated October 11, 1968, requested the Collector, Sabarkantha, to issue necessary orders to the Mamlatdar, Idar, to make appropriate entries regarding his rights in the minerals in village Isarwada.
He further urged that the two letters addressed by the respondent-one to the Collector on October 11, 1968 and the other to the Mamlatdar on October 4, 1971, merely contained a request to make appropriate entries in the Revenue Records based on the Mamlatdar's order dated November 24, 1959 and, therefore, the Collector could not pronounce upon those letters as containing a claim put forward by the respondent for the first time to mines and mineral products in the said Jagir villages to initiate an inquiry under section 37(2) of the Bombay Land Revenue de.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.
In these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under.s. 37(2) of the Code so far as his right to excavating gravel and stones from the two villages of Kapoda and Isarwada is concerned.
Admittedly, by his previous order dated November 24, 1959, the Mamlatdar of Talukadar, had declared that the respondent had been granted all the rights, particularly the right to quarry and remove gravel and Stones, in Isarwada and Kapoda villages in the year 1947 by the Idar Stale and that thereafter in the years 1952 and 1953 the Jagirdar had taken the produce of stone and that, therefore, the Government could not stop him from "taking out gravel and stones" but that the rights to excavating mica had been retained by the State; further, pursuant to this 'order the appropriate entry had been made in the relevant village records (Form No. 6) of village Kapoda on June 18, 1963, recognising the respondents right to, take out gravel and stones, which entry was verified and confirmed on March 30, 1965, it was in this situation that the respondent made the aforesaid two applications, one to the Collector, Sabarkantha and the other to the Mamladar Taluka Idar, whereby relying upon the previous order of the Mamlatdar dated November 24, 1959, he requested that appropriate entries pertaining to his right to gravel and stones should be similarly made in respect of village Isarwada.
In other words, before the Collector can initiate an inquiry under that provision, either the State or the individual must put forward a claim to a property or any right in or over the property and it is such claim that is to be inquired into by the Collector whose decision, subject to a civil suit filed within one year, is rendered final.
(3), the decision of the Collector under sub-s.
The main valid objection to the said inquiry is that the condition precedent the existence of which canlead to the initiation of such inquiry is absent here.
Thirdly, the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of Jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of Jagir has been abolished, whether it is proprietary or non- proprietary; in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the Jagir under s.2 (4) (i) is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a Jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of.
Secondly, compensation is made payable under section 11 of the Act to Jagirdars whose Jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a Jagir village, obviously because if by the grant in question the Jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved "to the Jagirdar under section 10 of the Act.
In the first place the, preamble and section 3 of the Act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish Jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the State of Bombay and to convert all Jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code.
section 10 contains an express saving provision relating to rights to mines and mineral products and it provides that "nothing in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, shall be deemed to affect the rights of any jagirdar subsisting on the appointed date to mines or mineral products in a jagir village granted or recognised under any contract., grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage.
