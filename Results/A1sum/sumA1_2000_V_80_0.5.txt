On behalf of the respondents, it is contended that the appellant had been managing the canteen up to the year 1982 and thereafter introduced the contract system for maintaining the canteen so established; that though the management of the canteen had been entrusted to the contractors from time to time, the personnel employed in the canteen were retained by all the contractors and they have been paid salaries through contractors; that the workmen employed in the canteen have been provided with ESI benefits under the Code No. VST, the appellant, and benefits arising under the Employees Provident Funds Act are also provided similarly; that the appellant has also provided a building along with furniture, utensils, cutlery, gas, electricity, water supply and other facilities; that the contractor is engaged only to prepare the food and serve it to the employees and that the quality of the food and the rates are controlled by the management of the appellant.
The appellant is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 with the object of manufacture and sale of cigarettes.
16.  The workmen have the protection of continuous employment in the establishment.
On behalf of the appellant contention put forth at the forefront is that a writ would not lie against the appellant inasmuch as the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and as an incident thereto has provided a canteen to its workmen pursuant to an obligation under Section 46 of the Act.
In such cases public duty is owed to the public in general and not specific to any person or group of persons.
It is unnecessary to examine the contention whether the matter is covered by a subsequent decision or not as the facts of the present case stand on its own.
13.  The wages of the canteen workers have to be reimbursed by the appellant.
In those circumstances, the Tribunal passed an award that these workmen should be treated as employees of the appellant and they are entitled to payment of appropriate scales and designations in terms of Ex.
14.  The supervision and control on the canteen is exercised by the appellant through its authorised officer, as can be seen from the various clauses of the contract between the appellant and the contractor.
The contributions like ESI, Provident Fund, etc. had also been categorically specified to be provided by the appellant and ESI code for the permanent establishment and for the present workmen was the same; that after the evidence was tendered by the workmen the appellant got the code changed and the appellant transferred the workmen from one place to another and that the amount to be surrendered by way of unpaid salaries had to be remitted back to the management.
On the merits of the matter, the appellant disputed various questions of fact and urged that the decision of this Court in Parimal Chandra Raha vs Life Insurance Corporation of India, 1995 Supp.
It was further explained in that decision that the term authority used in Article 226 of the Constitution should receive a liberal meaning unlike the term in Article 12, which is only for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 32.
The contesting respondents contended that the workmen in the canteen had been working right from its inception, that is, since 1967; that from 1976 onwards, after expiry of the contract with the Industrial Catering Services, they had been directly working with the appellant without any contractor; that they sought for regularization of their services by letter dated 28 February 1978; that the said letter was corrected and redrafted by the Personnel Manager to indicate the idea of floating an Association/Society to run the canteen; that this modified request contained in Ex.W-49 was stated to be contradictory to the stand taken by the workmen all through.
In De Smith, Woolf and Jowells Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 5th Edn., it is noticed that not all the Activities of the private bodies are subject to private law, e.g., the Activities by private bodies may be governed by the standards of public law when its decisions are subject to duties conferred by statute or when, by virtue of the function it is performing or possibly its dominant position in the market, it is under an implied duty to act in the public interest.
SCC 191 1996 Indlaw SC 618, and held that the workmen of a statutory canteen, as in the present case, would be workmen of an establishment for the purposes of the Act only and not for other purposes.
The learned Single Judge, who decided the matter in the first instance, held that a writ would lie against a company under a private management following the decision in T. Gattaiah vs Commissioner of Labour, 1981 [II ] LLJ 54 1981 Indlaw AP 26, in which it was held that establishment of a canteen and its maintenance is a statutory requirement; under Section 46 of the Act a public duty is imposed on the company to establish and maintain the canteen; inasmuch as members of the respondent-union are working in the canteen they are entitled to seek a mandamus.
A petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution by respondent No.1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the members of the respondent- union who are employees working in the canteen of the appellants factory as employees of the appellant and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits.
The Tribunal recorded the findings that the canteen had been working for the benefit of the workmen within the premises provided by and with the equipment supplied by the appellant; that the appellant supplies the provisions for the preparation of foodstuffs; that the appellant issues token to the employees, who on production of the same obtain foodstuffs from the canteen; that the Committee appointed by the appellant decides the menu and as per the directions and supervision of the Catering Officer, the canteen functions; that the quality and quantity of the foodstuffs is supervised by him, who functions under the Committee.
Thereafter, this Court further examined whether the material on record would show that the workmen are employees of the management for all purposes and adopted some of the tests as follows: 10.  The canteen has been there since the inception of the appellants factory.
But these factors do not come in the way of the award made by the Tribunal, as it is possible to locate the canteen in an appropriate place where there is no hazard of the kind envisaged under the Petroleum Rules.
In the circumstances aforesaid, the contention vis--vis the findings recorded by the Tribunal, we find absolutely no merit in these appeals and the same shall stand dismissed.
This is because the prisoners, for whose custody and care it is responsible, are in the prison in consequence of an order of the court, and the purpose and nature of their detention is a matter of public concern and interest.
On the merits of the matter, the learned Single Judge followed the decision in Parimal Chandra Rahas case holding that when the duty had been enjoined on the appellant to provide and maintain a canteen facility under the Factories Act it becomes the obligation of the appellant to establish a canteen and that is what the appellant had done.
Since we have held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, we would have set aside the order made by the High Court.
A contention is also sought to be made that it is not possible to run a canteen in the refinery area.
Employment in such institutions, therefore, is not devoid of any public character inasmuch as the service conditions of the academic staff were controlled by the University particularly in regard to their pay scales and the protection by University decisions creating a legal right or duty relationship between the staff and the management.
