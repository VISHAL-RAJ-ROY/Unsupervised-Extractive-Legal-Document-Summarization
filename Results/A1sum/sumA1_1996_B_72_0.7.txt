This Court further ordered: "we again wish to re-emphasize that the terms of the decree shall not effect the rights of the State of West Bengal, in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question, if they have vested in State under the provisions of the West Bengal Estate Acquisition Act of 1953 (Act X of 1954) ".
The Calcutta High Court, both the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench committed serious error of law in directing the Receiver to take possession of Nalban fishery from the State of West Bengal and deliver- the vacant possession of the same to the members of the Sarkar family.
He further contended that Nalban Fishery having been vested in the State of West Bengal under the provisions of West Bengal under the provisions of West Bengal Acquisition Act, 1955, the State cannot get rid of the direction given by the Supreme Court to the Receiver to handover possession of the various fisheries covered by the final decree to the parties to whom they have been allotted under the decree and the Nalban Fishery being one such fishery, the possession thereof was required to be given to the person in whose favour the said fishery has been allotted and therefore the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench in appeal have rightly issued the directions.
8.  In view of the rival submissions at the Bar the first question that arises for consideration is whether in the suit for partition amongst the members of the Sarkar family which was ultimately disposed of by a compromise decree in this Court Nalban Fishery had been allotted to some members of the Sarkar family and whether such decree would affect the rights of the State and bind the State of West Bengal.
Pursuant to the aforesaid requisition order the State of West Bengal took possession of the Nalban Fishery on 8.11.1969.
The suit ultimately no doubt was disposed of on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties but the court took sufficient care in disposing of the appeals on the terms of compromise by observing that the State has substantial interest with regard to fisheries rights covered by the litigation and nothing in the decree will not affect the rights of the State of West Bengal in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question if they are vested in the State under the provisions of West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953, It would be appropriate at this stage to extract this part of the decree passed by this Court: "In view of the foregoing, we again wish to re-emphasize that the terms the decree shall not affect the rights of the State of West Bengal, in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question, if they have vested in the state under the provisions of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 (Act X of 1954).
