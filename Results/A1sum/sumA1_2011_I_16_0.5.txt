" 18.  In Laxmidas Morarji v. Behrose Darab Madan (2009) 10 SCC 425 2009 Indlaw SC 1154, while dealing with the provisions of article 142 of the Constitution, this Court has held as under: " ... The power article 142 of the Constitution is a constitutional power and hence, not restricted by statutory enactments.
The said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the High Court.
In other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed, it is open to the Court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision.
Though the Supreme Court would not pass any order article 142 of the Constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject, at the same time these constitutional powers cannot in any way, be controlled by any statutory provisions.
(2) of section 5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing, impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year.
While deciding the said question, the Bench has also considered the scope of section 100 of the Code for entertaining the second appeal.
However, Mr. Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this Court in Yomeshbhai Pranshankar Bhatt vs State of Gujarat, (2011) 6 SCC 312 2011 Indlaw SC 370, submitted that in spite of limited notice, this Court, while exercising jurisdiction article 142 of the Constitution, in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial Court and the High Court.
To put it clear, in the 1988 Act, if an offence section 7 is proved, the same is punishable with imprisonment which shall be not less than six months and in the case of Section 13, it shall not be less than one year.
24.  From the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned, the following principles emerge: "a) When the Court issues notice confining to particular aspect/sentence, arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance/material is shown to the Court for arguing the matter on all aspects.
" 25.  In the light of the above discussion, we are unable to accept any of the contentions raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, we are in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Judge as affirmed by the High Court.
The orders do not disclose any factual details and the relevant provisions under which the accused was charged/convicted and minimum sentence, if any, as available in the Act as well as the period already undergone.
(f) The Special Judge, CBI, by order dated 19.03.2001, convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- and, in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable section 7 of the Act and one year rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.500/- and, in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable sections 13(1)(d) (ii) read with section 13(2) of the Act.
article 142 of the Constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice, if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.
These powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties...and are in the nature of supplementary powers...[and] may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.
We have gone through the facts in that case.
It is true that even in the cited decision, the appellant accused demanded only Rs. 250/- and it was paid and accepted.
(c) As the appellant-accused was dealing with the transfers, the complainant (PW-1) met him on 05.11.1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.
e) Though article 142 of the Constitution gives wider power to this Court, waiver of certain period as prescribed in the Statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.
(2) Any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine." (Emphasis supplied) 8.  It is useful to refer that in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 the same "criminal misconduct" which is available in section 13 of the 1988 Act had been dealt with in section 5 of the 1947 Act.
The relevant paras, which are useful, may be quoted: " We are fully alive of the fact that this Court has been exercising the power article 142 of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage where the Court finds that marriage is totally unworkable, emotionally dead, beyond salvage and has broken down irretrievably, even if the facts of the case do not provide a ground in law on which the divorce could be granted.
article 142 and its applicability 13.  By drawing our attention to article 142 of the Constitution of India, learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice, this Court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this Court.
In that case, taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months, considering all these aspects, while maintaining the conviction, this Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone.
10.  Learned senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that inasmuch as the incident had occurred on 14.11.1997 and the trial Court has convicted him on 19.03.2001 which was affirmed by the High Court on 03.10.2007, at this juncture, i.e., after a gap of 14 years, there is no need to retain the same sentence and the Court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.
Other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence: 9.  In order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above, learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this Court in Bechaarbhai section Prajapati vs State of Gujarat, (2008) 11 SCC 163 2008 Indlaw SC 297 and based on the same requested this Court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone.
In pursuance of the same, we permitted Mr. Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant-accused.
Inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28.01.2008 by this Court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in Yomeshbhai 2011 Indlaw SC 370 (supra), we feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points, consequently, we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant.
The appellant therein was convicted for offence section 7(2) of the Act and appeal before the High Court was also dismissed.
Quantum of sentence/Whether requires any reduction: 5.  Mr. Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14.11.1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then, the amount of Rs. 200/- said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job, leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.
The High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction, section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code and this Court, article 142 of the Constitution, would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly, when both the trial Court as also the High Court have found that the charge leveled against the appellant under the Act has been made out and proved by the prosecution by placing acceptable evidence.
The facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends, entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13.11.2009, in the proceedings pending before the Mediation Centre, Delhi, by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein, to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage.
However, we have also noticed various judgments of this Court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing, exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature, which is not permissible in law (vide Chetan Dass v. Kamla Devi (2001) 4 SCC 250 2001 Indlaw SC 20206 and Vishnu Dutt Sharma v. Manju Sharma (2009) 6 SCC 379 2009 Indlaw SC 330).
Hence, the appellant-accused has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this Court.
Consequently, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
On 11.11.1997, again he went to the office of the appellant but he could not find him on his seat.
K. Veeraswami v. Union of India : 1991 (3) SCC 655 1991 Indlaw SC 711, but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case, cannot be altogether ignored by this Court, while making an order article 142.
d) Merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the Act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence, particularly, when the Statute prescribes minimum sentence.
Since the appellant therein was convicted only section 7 and section 161 Cr.PC., the minimum sentence being six months and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six months, the course adopted by this Court is perfectly in order and the same cannot be applied to the case on hand, wherein the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum sentence was six months section 7 and one year section 13.
This Court, after holding that the conclusion of the trial Court and High Court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence.
Decree of divorce has been granted to put quietus to all litigations between the parties and to save them from further agony, as it is evident from the judgments in Romesh Chander v. Savitri (1995) 2 SCC 7 1995 Indlaw SC 329, Kanchan Devi v. Promod Kumar Mittal (1996) 8 SCC 90 1996 Indlaw SC 2663, Anita Sabharwal v. Anil Sabharwal (1997) 11 SCC 490 1996 Indlaw SC 4162, Ashok Hurra v. Rupa Bipin Zaveri (1997) 4 SCC 226 1997 Indlaw SC 2568, Kiran v. Sharad Dutt (2000) 10 SCC 243 1999 Indlaw SC 2077, Swati Verma v. Rajan Verma (2004) 1 SCC 123 2003 Indlaw SC 967, Harpit Singh Anand v. State of W.B. (2004) 10 SCC 505 2003 Indlaw SC 810, Jimmy Sudarshan Purohit v. Sudarshan Sharad Purohit (2005) 13 SCC 410 2004 Indlaw SC 2040, Durga Prasanna Tripathy v. Arundhati Tripathy (2005) 7 SCC 353 2005 Indlaw SC 486, Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli (2006) 4 SCC 558 2006 Indlaw SC 598, Sanghamitra Ghosh v. Kajal Kumar Ghosh (2007) 2 SCC 220 2006 Indlaw SC 775, Rishikesh Sharma v. Saroj Sharma (2007) 2 SCC 263 2006 Indlaw SC 994, Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511 2007 Indlaw SC 1000 and Satish Sitole v. Ganga (2008) 7 SCC 734 2008 Indlaw SC 1077.
i) The powers article 142 are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.
However, this Court would not pass any order article 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.
