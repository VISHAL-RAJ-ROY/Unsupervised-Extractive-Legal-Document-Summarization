By proceedings dated June 13, 1984, the Registrar of Trade Marks informed the appellant that the registered user's applications were abandoned since the appellant failed to comply with the statutory requirements.
The Division Bench or the learned single Judge did not record any finding as to the period up to which the bicycles could be imported into India and the period during which the ban was imposed but for which the respondent had an intention to import bicycles but were prevented to do so due to the ban.
(1) or for purpose of sub-s.
(2) of section 48 give defence to "permitted user" in relation to a registered trade mark.
(2) of section 48 otiose or surplus age which interpretation is impermissible.
An un-registered person section 48(1) or a person who did not register section (1) of section 48 shall not be deemed to be a registered user for the purpose of section 46 or any other law.
The High Court recorded a finding and it is not disputed across the bar, that the appellant had entered into an agreement with Sen Raleigh which was a permitted user and used the trade mark till November 1, 1976 and thereafter by registered user agreement dated December 20, 1976 used trade mark for a period of 5 years.
It would, thus, be apparent that subject to section 46, for a registered trade mark up to date within one month before the date of making application for rectification for a continuous period of 5 years or longer if registered trade mark had not been use during that period, there was no bona fide user in relation to those goods by the proprietor thereof for the time being.
Having regard to the extended nature of non-user of the concerned trade mark after November 1, 1976, any further use of the said trade marks by the respondents was likely to deceive and cause confusion to the trade and public alike in India etc.
(3) of section 46 must be such that the respondents had intended to use the registered trade mark.
It is his pivotal contention that undisputedly when the respondent was not in urge of trade mark as "a registered proprietor" or its agent Sen Raleigh as Permitted user" for a period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application section 46 for removal of the trade mark from the Register, there was no bona fide user thereof in relation to those goods by the proprietor himself.
It would, therefore, be clear that a permitted use of the trade mark should be done under sub-s.
section 48 provides for registered users which reads thus: '48.
Non registration of the user agreement by Sen Raleigh and the appellant was due to the default of the latter.
Sen Raleigh was taken over by the Government of India on September 8, 1975 under the IDR Act and the Government took over the management of Sen Raleigh Limited The agreement dated December 29, 1962 was modified and the respondents were given option to terminate the agreement.
The trade mark should be taken off and struck out form the register of trade marks in respect of any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered .
The appellant was unable to prove that there had been no such user of the trade mark for a continuous period of 61 months or longer and the lack of bona fide intention The expression "by any registered proprietors in section 46(1)(b) should not be restricted to user by proprietor or registered user who should also include bona fide or authorized users The legislature did not intend to register proprietor to be deprived of their property at the instance of user whose use is unregistered.
On March 28, 1978, joint application by Sen Raleigh and the appellant duly signed by the respondent as proprietor and Sen Raleigh Limited as registered user came to be made before the Registrar of Trade Marks.
It Should be either by the registered proprietor of the trade mark or a person other than the registered proprietor registered section 48(1) to use the trade mark by operation of sub-section (2).
The permitted use of trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed no to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purpose of section 46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Act or any other law.
It is contended that the registered user must be understood to be the user by the proprietor or authorized user registered under Section 48.
The Court in those circumstances declined to rectify the trade mark and strike it off from the register of trade marks.
- (1) Subject to the provisions of section 49, a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may, by rules made in this behalf, provide that no application for registration as such shall be entertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks.
(2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates".
