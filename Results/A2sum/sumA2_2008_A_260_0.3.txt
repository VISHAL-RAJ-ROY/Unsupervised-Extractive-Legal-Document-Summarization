26.  Accordingly, the two Civil Appeals, filed by the appellant herein, stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
The Legislature intended to obliterate appeal from "pre-grant proceedings", which existed earlier.
(5) While passing an order under Sub-s.
This is the controversy which needs to be resolved in this case.
In relation to patents that are of recent origin, a higher scrutiny is necessary.
(3) Every appeal under this section shall be in prescribed form and shall be verified in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be accompanied by a copy of the decision, order or direction appealed against any by such fees as may be prescribed.
The ground of challenge under section 25(1) is identical to section 25(2) of the said 1970 Act.
This is what has exactly happened in this case resulting into utter confusion with regard to pending FAO No.293/06 filed by respondent No.3 in the High Court section 116 of the Indian Patents Act, 1970 as amended by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 w.e.f. 26.3.99. 5.  Span Diagnostics Limited, respondent No.3 herein, is a public limited company established in 1972 to indigenously develop and manufacture a comprehensive range of ready- made diagnostic reagents made by clinical pathology laboratories.
However, the Legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent.
Under the said Amendment Act, 1999, as stated above, vide section 116 (2) a right of appeal was available to the aggrieved party against orders passed under section 25.
However, section 25 was brought into force vide Notification dated 20.5.2003.
The Legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the Appellate Board but by not bringing section 61 into force till 2.4.07, appeals filed during the interregnum, as in this case, became vulnerable and liable to be dismissed as misconceived as is contended by the appellant.
(4) in respect of the ground mentioned in cl.
7.  We quote herein below Ss. 25 and 116 as it stood in the year 2000 under the Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 which read as under: "section 25.
Even as on 20.5.2003 vide section 25 only one right to oppose a patent at the pre-grant stage was available and appeal against an order, passed by the earlier, lay before the High Court under the then existing section 116 of the Patents Act, 1970 for the reason that the amended Ss. 116 and 117A were not brought into force.
47 of Notes on Clauses attached to the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it has been clarified that section 64 is also amended vide Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 to confer wider jurisdiction on the Appellate Board in matters of revocation of patent, therefore, amended Section 117G which is brought into force only from 3.4.2007 dealt with transfer of pending proceedings from the High Court to the Appellate Board.
Respondent no.3, in both the cases, preferred first appeals to the High Court section 116 as it then stood.
(4) Every appeal shall be made within three months from the date of the decision, order or direction, as the case may be, of the Controller or the Central Government or within such further time as the Appellate Board may, in accordance with the rules made by it, allow.
For some unknown reasons, the amended Ss. 116 and 117A(2) were not brought into force till 2.4.07 whereas the concept of "pre- grant" and "post-grant" oppositions were brought into force w.e.f.1.1.2005.
Moreover, it may be noted that even Section 117G, which refers to transfer of pending proceedings to the Appellate Board, is also brought into force vide Notification dated 3.4.07.
(3) of Section 69, Section 78, Section 84, Section 86, section 88(3), Section 89, Section 93, section 96 and section 97." (3) Every appeal under this section shall be in writing and shall be made within three months from the date of the decision, order or direction, as the case may be, of the Controller, or within such further time as the High Court may in accordance with the rules made by it section 158 allow." (emphasis supplied by us) 8.  Suffice it to note that under Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 there was only one right given to a person interested to oppose the grant of patent by filing objections at the pre-grant stage.
(1) to (5) of Section 84, Section 85, Section 88, Section 91, section 92 and section 94.
20.  On the other hand, on behalf of respondent no.3, it has been urged that on 19.10.06 it had filed an appeal in the High Court under unamended section 116 of the parent Act; that, even though section 25 stood restructured w.e.f. 1.1.05 on account of absence of notification bringing the amended law into force, Ss. 116 and 117A (as amended) providing appeal to the Appellate Board came into force only with effect from 2.4.07 and, therefore, according to the said respondent, its first appeal being FAO No.293/06 continued to be governed by the law as it stood on 19.10.06 (on which date appeal to the High Court was maintainable); that, on 23.8.06 the "pre- grant opposition", filed by respondent no.3, stood rejected.
(3) (a) Where any such notice of opposition is duly given under Sub-section (2), the Controller shall notify the patentee.
(4) On receipt of the recommendation of the Opposition Board and after giving the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard, the Controller shall order either to maintain or to amend or to revoke the patent.
According to the appellant, it was open to respondent no.3 to challenge the grant of patent by making "post-grant opposition" under section 25(2) from which an appeal was maintainable to the Appellate Board.
By reason of Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 Act is different from what existed earlier.
Under the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, appeal is provided to the Appellate Board against the order of the Controller under section 25(4).
Opposition to the patent.
Vide cl.
Even here, not all provisions were simultaneously brought into force.
However, that statutory appeal is maintainable only in "post-grant opposition" proceedings whereas respondent no.3 herein has instituted first appeals under the law then prevailing, challenging the Order rejecting "pre-grant opposition" dated 23.8.06.
Ss. 116 and 117A were reworded which read as under: "section 116.
Only certain sections of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 were brought into force.
" 18.  On reading amended Section 117G it becomes clear that all appeals against any order or decision of the Controller had to be transferred to the Appellate Board from such date as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette.
In Section 117A of the principal Act [as inserted by section 47 of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002, in Sub-section (2), for the words and figures "section 20, Section 25, Section 27, Section 28,", the words, figures and brackets "section 20, Sub- section (4) of Section 25, Section 28" shall be substituted."* *(this section was not brought into force till 2.4.2007)" 15.  In short, by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the Patent Law between "opposition to the pre-grant" and "opposition to the post-grant of patent".
That provision came to be made only under the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 which was promulgated on 4.4.2005 w.e.f. 1.1.2005.
17.  On 19.10.2006 when FAO No.293/06 was filed in the High Court, Chapter XIX of the parent Act as amended vide Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002 and the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 as the amended Ss. 116 and 117A were brought into force only vide Notification dated 2.4.07.
(2) or Sub-s.
In the special circumstances of this case, particularly when after 2.4.07 appeals against orders rejecting "pre-grant opposition" are not maintainable and particularly when FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 were filed by respondent no.3 prior to 2.4.07 under the old law, we are of the view that these two appeals shall be heard and decided by the High Court in accordance with law.
13.  Vide section 23 of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, the then existing section 25 was substituted.
12.  Without giving effect to the amendments to Ss. 116 and 117A suggested by section 47 of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002, on 4.4.2005 the Legislature enacted the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005.
One more point needs to be noted.
This was the major structural change in the Patent Law.
Further, according to the appellant, "pre-grant opposition" was filed by respondent no.3 under section 25(1) on 21.3.05.
According to the appellant, with the change in section 25 brought about by Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, a dichotomy was introduced in the Patents Act, 1970.
section 25 of the Patents Act, 1970 as amended by Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 dealt with opposition to a patent vides section 25.
Section 117A. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in Sub- section (2), no appeal shall lie from any decision, order or direction made or issued under this Act by the Central Government, or from any act or order of the Controller for the purpose of giving effect to any such decision, order or direction.
(e) of that sub- section, no account shall be taken of any secret use.
Therefore, there is no point in transferring the pending FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 to the Appellate Board which has no authority to decide matters concerning "pre-grant opposition".
19.  The question which arises for determination in this batch of civil appeals is : whether FAO No.292/06 and FAO No.293/06 filed by respondent no.3 herein in the High Court were liable to be dismissed.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided in Sub-section (1), an appeal shall lie to a High Court from any decision, order or direction of the Controller under any of the following provisions, that is to say, Section 15, Section 16, Section17, Section 18, Section 19, Section 20, Section 25, Section 27, Section 28, Section 51, Section 54, Section 57, Section 60, Section 61, Section 63, Sub-s.
