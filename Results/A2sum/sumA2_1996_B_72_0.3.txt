The appeal arising out of the petition suit bearing Suit No. 2539 of 1955 which had been registered as appeal No. 200 of 1960 was finally disposed of by the Division Bench and the said order was assailed in this Court in SLP (C) Nos.
The respondents are the members of one Sarkar family in the city of Calcutta.
This order of the learned Single Judge was challenged in appeal before the Division Bench and the Division Bench having dismissed the same, the present appeals have been preferred.
5.  Mr. Harish Salve, the learned Senior Counsel for the State of West Bengal, Mr. section section Ray, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for Bansilal Farms and Mr. G. Ramaswamy, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State Fishery Development Corporation Ltd. contended that a compromise decree between the parties in a suit for partition will not in army way affect the rights of the State in respect of the fisheries whether such rights the State acquires by virtue of an order of requisition under the Requisition Act or by virtue of any other statutory provisions under which the fisheries right vest in the State.
Mr. Ray the learned senior counsel appearing for Bansilal Farms in addition to the contentions raised by Mr. Salve appearing for the State of West Bengal contended that the State being the owner of Nalban Fishery and having vested the management and control thereof with the State Fishery Development Corporation and the said Corporation having decided to use the tank fishery for a Boating Complex and the Bansilal Farms being the highest bidder and having been granted the right to have a Boating Complex therein and he having invested a huge sum of money, his rights cannot be taken away in the dispute between the State and the Sarkar family.
The said two appeals arising out of the said two special leave petitions were disposed of by order dated 18.4.1979 on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties on intervention of Shri Ashok Sen who appearing for one of the parties but it was indicated in the order that the State's right in relation to the fisheries will not be affected by the decree in question.
The three appellants are the State of West Bengal in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 401 of 1993, the State Fishery Development Corporation Ltd. in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 13516 of 1992 and Bansilal Farms in appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 13314 of 1992.
3.  Prior to the passing of the aforesaid order on April 18, 1979 while granting special leave petition on 10.11.1978 this Court had directed that the State of West Bengal will be made a party to the proceeding and further the Collector Parganas was appointed as Receiver in respect of the fisheries owned by the Sarkar family.
It is also not disputed that the State of West Bengal though was not a party to the suit but in course of proceeding before this Court by an order of the Court the said State of West Bengal was impleaded as a party.
The schedule of properties included the disputed Nalban Fishery.
Mr. Gupta, also contended that the order of the High Court of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Deepak Kumar Sen dated 23.9.1980 directing the Receiver to allow M/s. Ghose and Saha Surveyors to make proper demarcation in the Nalban Fishery dividing the same in two lots and thereafter carry out the directions of the Supreme Court in respect thereof has become final, the same not having been challenged by the State of West Bengal and therefore, it would not be open for the said State in application for execution of the decree to raise the question of vesting of the Nalban Fishery with the State and the Court would not interfere with the direction given by the learned single Judge and Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court.
On the question of vesting of the tank fishery under the amended provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, Mr. Gupta contended that the validity of the said Act has been challenged and is pending before the Calcutta High Court, an interim order has been passed in the said proceeding and therefore until that matter is decided it cannot be said that the tank fishery vested with the State of West Bengal.
The suit ultimately no doubt was disposed of on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties but the court took sufficient care in disposing of the appeals on the terms of compromise by observing that the State has substantial interest with regard to fisheries rights covered by the litigation and nothing in the decree will not affect the rights of the State of West Bengal in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question if they are vested in the State under the provisions of West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953, It would be appropriate at this stage to extract this part of the decree passed by this Court: "In view of the foregoing, we again wish to re-emphasize that the terms the decree shall not affect the rights of the State of West Bengal, in any manner whatsoever to the fisheries in question, if they have vested in the state under the provisions of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 (Act X of 1954).
