The respondent M/s. Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited is engaged in the business of shipping and allied activities and owns a fleet of tanker vessels for charter, including the vessel known as JAG PRAJA .
It was pointed out that the vessels which are not chartered under the tender floated would be at a disadvantage.
An agreement, called the Time Charter Party in legal parlance, was entered into between the appellant and the respondent on 6th May, 1997 for letting on hire vessels for a period of two years from 22nd September, 1996 to 30th June, 1997 and from 1st July, 1997 to 30th June, 1998, on the terms and conditions set out in the said agreement.
It was only after a gap of about seven months that on 15th March, 2000, the IOC informed the respondent about the evaluation of the tenders in terms of the order passed by the High Court.
In nutshell, the Tribunal was of the view that with the performance, original charter party dated 6th May, 1997 got extinguished.
Thereafter, in September, 1998, the IOC for and on behalf of the Oil Industry, floated a fresh tender for carriage of petroleum products along the Indian coast on time charter basis for a period of one year commencing from 1st September, 1998 to 31st August, 1999, on the terms and conditions set out in the tender document.
However, before the Charter Party was to come to an end, on 29th June, 1998, the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (for short IOC ), acting as agent of the appellant, issued a fax to various ship owners, including the respondent herein, requesting them to extend the validity of the Charter Party Agreement dated 6th May, 1997 beyond 30th June, 1998 for a period of one month from 1st July, 1998 with option for two further extensions of 15 days each.
In the alternative, it was suggested by the respondent that the charter period be extended by six months on the existing terms and conditions at a mutually discussed time charter rate.
The said fax message was an internal communication between the Oil Coordination Committee and the Oil Companies.
Charter hire rate worked out by the Committee for vessel JAG PRAJA for the period from 1st September, 1998 to 31st August, 1999 was communicated to the respondent.
Vide order dated 12th May, 2003 the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the appellant having invoked the arbitration clause contained in charter party agreement dated 6th May, 1997, which was valid upto 31st August, 1998 and as the dispute between the parties related to the period subsequent to 31st August, 1998, they had no jurisdiction to decide the Reference.
Laying emphasis on the fax message dated 26th August, 1998 addressed by the Oil Co-ordination Committee to the oil companies, including the appellant, inter alia, informing them that no further extension of the Current Charter Hire Rate will be allowed, learned counsel submitted that the said message made it clear to all concerned that Charter Party dated 6th May, 1997 would not be extended under any circumstance.
On 31st October, 1998 the IOC faxed to the respondent relevant portion of the message received by them from Oil Co- ordination Committee, extending the period of usage of the existing coastal tanker fleet for the month of October, 1998, at 80% charter hire rates, prevailing till 30th June, 1998, on provisional basis, subject to adjustment of provisional charter hire with retrospective date from 1st September, 1998 against the revised charter hire, to be finalised by the Oil Industry in response to the tender floated by IOC on 1st September, 1998.
It was thus, held that the charter party dated 6th May, 1997 did not come to an end by efflux of time and it was extended by the parties on the same terms and conditions except the rate of hire.
It was suggested that an agreement may be signed between them for the period from 1st September, 1998 until the matter was finally decided by the appellant under the tender, on the existing terms and conditions with the charter hire being provisionally paid on ad hoc basis at 90% of the rate which was prevailing under the existing Charter Party.
