It is, therefore, necessary to briefly examine the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
The learned trial Judge then sought clarification from the witnesses by putting the following question.
Thereafter, he gave a report about the incident in writing at the police station.
The deceased Bhimabai was daughter of PW.1 Tukaram Eknath Tambe resident of village Sanjkheda and she was married to appellant No. 1 Appasaheb son of Sheshrao Palaskar about two and half years prior to the date of incident which took place on 15 September 1991.
and that was the cause.
3 Sandu, Police Patil of village Palshi has deposed that at about 4.20 p.m. on 15 September 1991, Narayan who is uncle of appellant no.1, Appasaheb, informed him that the wife of Appasaheb had expired.
According to the case of prosecution, a sum of Rs. 5000 and some gold ornaments had been given at the time of marriage of Bhimabai.
The report of the post-mortem examination was admitted by the defence.
The specific case of the prosecution is that Bhimabai ended her life by consuming poison because of harassment caused to her by the appellants for or in connection with demand of dowry.
" In the very next paragraph she stated as under :- "It is not true to suggest that in my statement before the police I never said that ill-treatment was as a result of demand for money from us and its fulfillment.
Bhimabai had complained to him that she was not being given proper food, clothings and even footwear and occasionally the appellant No. 1 used to beat her.
He has admitted that it was appellant No. 1 who had sent a person on motorcycle who had given information regarding Bhimabai being unwell and that both the appellants were present at the time of her funeral.
PW.2 Babaji is real brother of father-in-law of PW.1 Tukaram.
PW.1 then immediately went to the house of the accused along with some of his relatives.
This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench), by which the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed and their conviction under Section 304-B read with Section 34 IPC and sentence of 7 years RI imposed thereunder by the learned Sessions Judge, Aurangabad, was affirmed.
Whenever Bhimabai went to her parental home, she used to tell her parents that her husband and mother-in-law (accused appellants) were harassing her and used to occasionally beat her.
Thereafter, the accused treated Bhimabai properly but after about four months they again started harassing her.
The witness has further deposed that on the date of incident, a man came from village Palshi on motorcycle and informed that he should immediately go there as Bhimabai was not well.
She has stated in her examination-in-chief that Bhimabai was being ill-treated by the appellants and the reason for ill-treatment was that they were demanding money to be brought from her parental home.
He has deposed that on an earlier occasion he had gone along with PW.1 and some others to the house of appellant no.1 to persuade him not to harass Bhimabai and to treat her well.
She has specifically stated that for a period of six months after the marriage, Bhimabai was treated well and thereafter she had started complaining about the harassment being caused to her.
