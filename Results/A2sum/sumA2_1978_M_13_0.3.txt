Aggrieved by this order passed by the Collector on February 23, 1973, the respondent preferred a writ petition (Special Civil Application No. 1224 of 1973) under article 227 of the Constitution to the, Gujarat High Court and writ of certiorari quashing the order dated February 23, 1973 and a direction restraining the Collector from further proceeding with the inquiry under section 37(2) of the Land Revenue Code were sought.
section 8 declares that all public roads, lands, paths, bridges, titches, dikes, and fences, on or besides the same, the bed of the sea and of harbours, creeks below high water mark, and of rivers, streams, nalaps lakes, wells and tanks, and all canals and water courses etc, situated in jagir village shall vest in the State Government and shall be deemed to be the property of the State Government and all rights held by such jagirdars in such property shall be deemed to have been extinguished.
According to the learned counsel for the respondent unless a claim to property or rights over property was Made either by the State against any person or by any person against the State, there could be no occasion for the Collector to held an inquiry contemplated by section 37(2) of the Code.
It appears that for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act the competent authority (Collector of District Sabarkantha) held an inquiry into the question whether the respondent's Jigir was proprietary (involving any right or interest in the soil) or non-proprietary (involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to Government) under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence led before it, the competent authority by its order dated September 8, 1959, held that the Daljitgarh Jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act that a particular Jagir 'was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products which were expressly saved under section 10 of the Act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act, while coming to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was proprietary one, bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights such as right to sell fire-wood, babul trees, saltrees, timru trees, right to sell agriculture land and house sites; right to sell stones and gravel, right to sell or allow use of land for manufacture of bricks-enjoyed by the respondent since the time the grant had been made in his favour by the then Ruler and it was on the basis of such evidence that tile competent authority had come to the conclusion that the respondent's Jagir was a proprietary one.
These reliefs sought by the respondent were resisted by the State of Gujarat and the Collector (the appellants before us) principally on the ground that the inquiry under section 37(2) of the Land Revenue Code into the rights to mines and mineral products in the said villages claimed by the respondent was necessary and proper and could not be said to- be concluded by the determination made under section 2 (4) (1) of the Act by the competent authority.
It further appears that pursuant to an order dated November 24, 1959, passed by the Mamlatdar, Idar, an entry was made on June 18, 1963, in the relevant revenue records (village Form No. 6) of one of the villages Kapoda comprised in the Jagir to the effect that the respondent's right to take out gravel and stones was recognised but the right relating to excavation of mica had been reserved and retained by the Government; this entry was only certified on March 30, 1965.
The general question is whether once the competent authority under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act declares that the particular Jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under section 37(2) of the Land Revenue Code with a view to determining whether the Jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such Jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent ? The other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under section 2(4) (i), the further inquiry initiated by the Collector under section 37(2) was misconceived and uncalled for ? Dealing with the first question which is of a general character, it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under section 2 (4) (i) of the Act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the Act and.
