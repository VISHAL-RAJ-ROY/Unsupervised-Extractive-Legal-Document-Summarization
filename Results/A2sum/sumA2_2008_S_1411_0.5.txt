(2) whereof inter alia enables allotment of a final plot from an original plot by transfer of any adjoining lands.
We are of the opinion that even if he had any such right, he waived the same.
" In view of the above, the issue is whether it was open to him to assert his purported right to special notice in respect of the final allotment in the instant case given the fact that he did not pursue his objections to the draft scheme and subsequently did not object/participate during the proceedings for re-allotment.
He was, therefore, in his own right entitled to final allotment of some plot.
m. of land had been acquired for public purpose out of the said plot No. 17/8.
28.  It is also not in dispute that the appellant filed an objection in regard to the draft scheme but did not eventually pursue the same.
27.  Appellant was a tenant in respect of plot No. 17/8.
But he must be in possession of the property on the crucial date i.e. when the Town Planning Scheme is notified in the official Gazette.
In that context, it was held: "The question is whether the tenant or a sub- tenant is a person interested and is entitled to notice.
Sub-rule (3) of Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for issuance of a special notice upon the person interested in any plot or in any particular plot comprised in the Scheme.
It makes it obligatory on the part of the officer to give notice of the date on which he will commence his duties and shall state therein the time, within which the owner of any property or rights which is injuriously affected by the making of the town planning scheme shall be advertised in one or more newspapers published in the regional language and circulating within the jurisdiction of the local authority and shall be posted in prominent places at or near the area comprised in the scheme and at the office of the Town Planning Officer.
Rule 21 of the Bombay Rules provides for the Procedure to be followed by the Town Planning Officer.
" 19.  Before embarking upon the rival contentions, we may also notice that the provisions of the Bombay Town Planning Rules, 1955 (for short "the Bombay Rules") are in pari materia with 'the Rules'.
Such notice shall also be posted at the officer of the Town Planning Officer and of the appropriate authority and the substance of such notice shall be pasted at convenient places in the said locality.
(3) The Town Planning Officer shall, before proceeding to deal with the matters specified in section 52, publish a notice in Form H in the Official Gazette and in one or more Gujarati newspapers circulating within the area of the appropriate authority.
67 - Effect of preliminary scheme On the day on which the preliminary scheme comes into force- (a) all lands required by the appropriate authority shall, unless it is otherwise determined in such scheme, vest absolutely in the appropriate authority free from all encumbrances; (b) all rights in the original plots which have been re-constituted into final plots shall determine and the final plots shall become subject to the rights settled by the Town Planning Officer.
It inter alia provides for giving of a notice by the Town Planning Officer as follows: "(1) In a preliminary scheme, the Town Planning Officer shall,- (i) after giving notice in the prescribed manner and in the prescribed form to the persons affected by the scheme, define and demarcate the areas allotted to, or reserved for, any public purpose, or for a purpose of the appropriate authority and the final plots; (ii) after giving notice as aforesaid, determine in a case in which a final plot is to be allotted to persons in ownership in common, the shares of such persons;" 17.  Further, Sub-s.
m. of the land of original plot No. 17/8 should be allowed to continue thereupon and final allotment made in favour of the respondent No. 3 to that extent should be cancelled.
Further, it appears that if the interest of the landlord and of the tenant is common and in absence of any inter se dispute between the landlord and tenant, even if any portion of the land which is in possession of the tenant is included in the scheme, the proper remedy for the tenant would be to claim for compensation to that extent and if such compensation is not received by him, he may resort to proper remedy available for recovery of the compensation to the extent of the area in his occupation.
Therefore, as per the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Rules, 1979 rule 33 the undersigned in exercise of powers conferred below section 68(1) and 8(2) of the Bombay Provincial Municipalities Act and below the section 68 notice under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act this is to inform you that as shown in the sketch on the reverse the premises marked should be vacated within 7 days from receipt of the notice and had over the possession to the Surat Municipal Corporation.
The said Final Plot/ Original Plot is allotted in lieu of your No. 17/7, 17/8 paiki land.
m. of land of plot No. 17/8 has merged in final plot No. 165 owned by the respondent No. 3. 6.  The Scheme was notified in the year 1999.
In respect of the proceedings initiated for the purpose of re-allotment of the land, despite a public notice, the appellant did not file any objection.
m. of land was taken over leaving only 200 sq.
For the said public purpose, viz., widening of the road, 867 sq.
