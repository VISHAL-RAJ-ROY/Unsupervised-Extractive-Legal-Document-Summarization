The High Court took a different view and held that Chunderbutti took the estate in her character as a Hindu widow.
30.  Reference was also made to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Mst.
Generally speaking, there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a Hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that.
My self-acquired properties shall on my death be enjoyed by my wife till her death and after her death they shall pass to my daughter.
The remainder was disposed of in the following words: - "If on the death of my wife and my niece there be living a son and a daughter born of the womb of my said brother's daughter, then two-thirds of the movable property will belong to the son and one-third to the daughter.
Considering the will in the light of these principles,it seems to us that Lakshminarayan Iyer intended by his will to direct that his entire properties should be enjoyed by his widow during her lifetime but her interest in these properties should come to an end on her death, that all these properties in their entirety should thereafter be enjoyed as absolute owners by his daughter and her heirs with powers of alienation, gift, exchange and sale from generation to generation.
