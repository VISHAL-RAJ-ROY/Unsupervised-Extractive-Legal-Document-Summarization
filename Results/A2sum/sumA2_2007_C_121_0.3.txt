The said demand was based on an agreement detected by the Department.
Ltd. AIR 1965 Bombay 35 1961 Indlaw MUM 91, it has been held vide paras '27' and '30' that the Trade Marks Act merely facilitates the mode of proof.
As already stated by me while referring to the observations of Sir John Romily, it is not really necessary for me to decide in this case as to whether there could or could not be any property in a trade mark for the purpose of deciding this case.
Hence, these civil appeals.
We quote hereinbelow paras '27' and '30' of the said judgment which read as follows: "At any rate, it must be remembered that in this case I am not dealing with a passing-off action or an action for infringement of a trade mark which is alleged to be common property.
18.  Applying the ratio of the above judgment to the present case, it is clear that grant of registration certificate under the Trade Marks Act will not automatically provide benefit of exemption to the SSI Unit.
This argument is based on the concept of abandonment.
The latter type of mark would evidently refer to a distinctive mark, a mark which does not directly describe the nature or quality of the goods to which it is attached.
The question before us is : what is the effect of issuance of registration certificate with retrospective effect.
Before the Deputy Registrar and before Mr. Justice Shah, proprietorship was claimed on the basis that the applicant was entitled to it as an importer's mark.
The mark can be originated by a person or can be acquired, but in all cases it is necessary that the person putting forward the application should be in possession of some proprietary right which, if questioned, can be substantiated".
In many of those cases, the dispute was between a foreign trader using a foreign mark in a foreign country on goods which were subsequently imported by Indian importers and sold by them in this country under that very mark.
In cases of such marks, whereas the Courts of Equity did require some slight user before the proprietor thereof could institute an action for infringement thereof, the statute enabled the registration of such mark without any user at all, because such mark being distinctive per se it was not necessary for the person applying for its registration to show that mark had acquired a reputation in the market, so that it could be associated only with his goods and of nobody else.
Accordingly, the Commissioner (A) dismissed the appeals.
19.  In the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Chandigarh v. Bhalla Enterprises 2004 (173) ELT 225 2004 Indlaw SC 996(SC), this Court held that the assessee will not be entitled to the benefit of exemption if it uses on goods in question, same/similar brand name with intention of indicating a connection with the goods of the assessee and such other person or uses the name in such manner that it would indicate such connection.
Registration itself does not create a trade mark.
The same is quoted hereinbelow: "Explanation IX "Brand name" or "trade name" shall mean a brand name or trade name, whether registered or not, that is to say a name or a mark, such as symbol, monogram, label, signature or invented word or writing which is used in relation to such specified goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between such specified goods and some person using such name or mark with or without any indication of the identity of that person.
The particular mode of acquisition of proprietorship relied upon by the applicant in this case is of his user for the first time in India in connection with watches and allied goods mentioned by him of the mark "Caltex", which at the material time was a foreign mark belonging to Degoumois & Co. of Switzerland and used by them in respect of watches in Switzerland.
No explanation has been given as to why Madan Verma has not been examined by the appellants.
Unquestionably, the applicant's user was not large, but that fact makes no difference, because so far as this country is concerned, the mark was a new mark in respect of the class of goods in respect of which the applicant used it.
The first Trade Marks Act in England was passed in 1875.
At the outset, we may reiterate that the object of the exemption Notification was neither to protect the owners of the trade mark nor the consumers from being misled.
7.  In this connection, reliance was placed by the Commissioner (A) on the said Agreement dated 22.11.89.
32.  Then turning to the label as it stood at the date of the application, two names appeared on the label, one of Kipre and Co. and the other of the respondent company.
He came to the conclusion vide his orders that the trade name "Meghraj" was in the form of a logo printed on the wrapper of the biscuits and, therefore, the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of Notification No.1/93-CE dated 28.2.93 as amended by Notification No.59/94 dated 1.3.94.
This argument was rejected by the Commissioner (A) saying that the appellants were using the brand name "Meghraj" on their products.
24.  The Trade Marks Act, 1999 has been enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to trade marks, to provide for registration and better protection of trade marks and for prevention of the use of fraudulent marks.
11.  One more fact needs to be mentioned that on 30.6.2000 the Registrar of Trade Marks appears to have issued Registration Certificate on 30.6.2000 registering the trade mark "Meghraj" in favour of the appellants with effect form 30.9.91.
The orders of the Commissioner (A) have been confirmed by Order dated 11.4.2000 passed by CEGAT.
20.  Applying the above test to the facts of the present case, Madan Verma is a common Director in the two companies.
Even prior thereto, it was firmly established in England that a trader acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade, and that he was entitled to protect such right of property by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a Court of law.
6.  Aggrieved by the decision of the Adjudicating Authority, the assessee preferred appeals to the Commissioner (A).
It appears that issuance of this certificate was mentioned before the CEGAT which rejected the Rectification Application on 8.12.2000.
This contention was rejected by the Commissioner (A) on the ground that under the Notification No.1/93-CE, as amended, exemption was not available to the specified goods bearing brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person.
The object of the exemption Notification No.1/93-CE was to grant benefits to those industries which do not have the advantage of a brand name.
In the circumstances, we do not find any merit in this appeal.
Mr. Shah, however, contended that by an agreement exhibit F. made between the respondent company and Kipre and Co. Private Ltd. in 1951 it was clearly provided that the mark "Monarch" belonged to the respondent company, that Kipre and Co. Private Ltd. were only to manufacture the food products as ordered by the respondent company and that the food products so manufactured were to be bottled and packed by them for its use and benefit and that, therefore, in spite of Kipre and Co.'s name appearing on the labels, the respondent company was the true proprietor of the mark "Monarch" and that, therefore, it was entitled to apply for its registration as proprietor thereof.
To my mind it is clear that even prior to the passing of this Act the owner of a trade mark could maintain an action for the infringement of a trade mark and that action could only be maintained on the assumption that he was the owner of the trade mark and he had a proprietary right in the trade mark.
28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, registration gives to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the Trade Marks Act.
Further there is no evidence to show as to whether M/s. Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd. was an "eligible manufacturer".
These are considerations which are relevant in disputes arising under the Trade Marks Act.
The biscuits were sold in wrapper mentioning the name of the appellants, "M/s. Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd." or "Meghraj".
