" 3.  Thereafter, the appellant filed writ petition O.P. No. 4612 of 1996 for quashing the said order and for a direction to sanction and establish an Engineering College.
It was however contended that the Tamil Nadu case was concerned only with the standards of education and as to who could fix them.
Also there were four Engineering Colleges at Kannur, Trichur, Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram Districts and three Private (Aided) Engineering Colleges at Palakkad, Ernakulam (Kothamangalam) and Kollam Districts.
In so far as institutions imparting technical education were concerned, the University or the State Government had no independent role to play except to the extent provided in the above said enactment, in the present case, the AICTE had made inspections and was satisfied that the necessary infrastructure was available and that the appellant would be able to conform to the required standards of the education.
(k) of section 10(1) and it provides that the Council might "grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned.
(9) of the statute required "verification of the facilities that may exist for starting the new colleges/course".
The appellant's college was shown as one of the colleges among the affiliated colleges for the said period.
10 of the Act, it is stated that it is the duty of the Council constituted under the Act to take all steps as the said Council might think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated develop-ment of technical education and maintenance of standards.
"it is not the University Act and the University but it is the Central Act and the Council created under it which will have the jurisdiction.
25.   Thus, in the two passages set out above, this Court clearly held that because of section 10(k) of the Central Act which vested the powers of granting approval in the Council, the T.N. Act of 1976 and the University Act, 1923 could not deal with any questions of 'approval' for establishment of technical institutions.
The Government of Tamil Nadu granted permission to the Trust for the academic year 1987-88 to start an Engineering college.
(9) stated that the affiliation "shall depend upon the fulfilment by the management of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment and maintenance of the proposed institutional courses of studies and on the reports of inspection by the Commission or Commissions which the University may appoint for the purpose".
Sub-cl. 6 of Regulation 8 states that the State Level Committee constituted under Regulation 9(4) is to consider the recommendations of the State Government and others mentioned in regulation 8(4) and that it is to make its recommendations to the Central Task Force constituted under regulation 9(5) and consider the recommendations of the State Level Committee and send its recommendations to the Member Secretary of the Council.
In case of difference of opinion as between the various consultees, the AICTE would have to go by the views of the Central Task Force.
" 19.   Sub-cl. 10 of Regulation 8 states that the decision of the Council shall be communicated to the State Government concerned or the UGC, as the case may be, the concerned University or the State Board, the Regional Office and the applicant before 30th April in case the application was made before the preceding 31st December.
It was stated that inasmuch as the State Act, "will overlap and will be in conflict with the provisions of the Central Act in various areas........., granting approval for starting new technical institution........., inspection of technical institution ............which are matters covered by the Central Act.
9(7) is to the Commission of Inspection appointed by the University.
Whether they were preconstitutional or a post constitutional laws, they would be repugnant to the AICTE Act passed by Parliament under Entry 66 of List I. In the above case this Court referred to the various provisions of the AICTE Act and on the question of repugnancy held as follows : "Hence on the subjects covered by the statute, the State could not make a law under Entry 25 of List III after the Forty-Second Amendment.
The University could not, therefore, in any event have sought for 'approval' of the State Government.
(n) to take necessary steps to prevent commercialisation of technical education, cl.
26.   Statutory powers of the State of Kerala and the M.G. University : 27.  The question is as to how far the judgment in the Tamil Nadu case is to be applied in the State of Kerala.
The AICTE had granted condition approval and the conditions were specified in Annexure I to the order and the general conditions were enlisted in Annexure II.
The Division Bench, however, observed that the appellant was at liberty to make a fresh application to the Government of Kerala for according sanction for setting up the Engineering College or to request the Government to consider the earlier application, for a future academic year.
For the purposes of performing its functions under the Act, the Council may (a) undertake survey in various fields of technical education, collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education; (b) coordinate the development of technical education in the country at all levels; (c) allocate and disburse out of the Fund of the Council such grants on such terms and conditions as it may think fit to (i) technical institutions, and (ii) Universities imparting technical education in coordination with the Commission; (d) promote innovations, research and development in established and new technologies, generation adoption and adaptation of new technologies to meet developmental requirements and for overall improve-ment of educational processes; (e) formulate schemes for promoting technical education for women, handicapped and weaker sections of the society; (f) promote an effective link between technical education system and other relevant systems including research and development organisations, industry and the community; (g) evolve suitable performance appraisal systems for technical institutions and Universities imparting technical education, incorpo-rating norms and mechanisms for enforcing accountability; (h) formulate schemes for the initial and in-service training of teachers and identify institutions or centres and set up new centres for offering staff development programmes including continuing education of teachers; (i) lay down norms and standards for courses, curricula, physical and instructional facilities, staff pattern, staff qualifications, quality instructions, assessment and examinations (j) fix norms and guidelines for charging tuition and other fees.
1995 Indlaw SC 1631 7.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant Sri T.L. Viswanatha Iyer also contended that though the State Government stated in its counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the "policy" of the Government was not to grant approval to self-financing engineering colleges to be established, such a policy could not come in the way of the appellant in view of what this Court has stated in similar circumstances in Thirumuruga Kirupan & Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v. State of Tamil Nadu & Others, [1996] 3 SCC 15 1996 Indlaw SC 858. 8.   On the other hand learned Additional Solicitor General Sri Mukul Rohtagi contended on behalf of the State of Kerala that the "Policy" of the State of Kerala at the relevant time was not to grant approval for establish-ment of more engineering colleges in the State.
2.  In the event of contravention of the conditions, guidelines, norms and regula-tions of the AICTE, the AICTE could withdraw the approval at any time.
Reg.. 4(2)........................." 16.   Regulation 5 deals with the Forms of the Applications and Regulation 6 deals with the conditions for grant of approval, Sub-cls.
The appellant sent a reminder to the Government on 26.8.1995 for permission for starting the college for the academic year 1995-96 and ultimately the Government refused permission by informing the appellant by a letter dated 16.8.1996 as follows : "In inviting your attention to the reference cited, I am to inform you that Government regret their inability to comply with your request.
Regulations have been framed on 31st October, 1994 by the AICTE in exercise of powers conferred on it by section 23(1) of the AICTE Act.
If the University statute required 'approval', it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act.
The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Government and dismissed the writ petition.
We have already pointed out under Point 1 that in the Tamil Nadu case, section 10(k) of the AICTE Act was referred to and the power of 'approval' for establishing a technical institution was considered, in our opinion, even if there was a State law in the State of Kerala which required the approval of the State Government for establishing technical institutions, such a law would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act and void to that extent, as held in the Tamil Nadu case.
The direction to pass a fresh order of affiliation was issued in view of the fact that the University contended before the learned Single Judge that unless the Government granted approval, permanent affiliation could not be granted.
The Government had clarified in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the Government "was not in a position" to take a decision to start new engineering colleges, without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering graduates from the State and without exploring the possibility of employment opportunities in the country as a whole.
Regulation 2 states that these regulations will be applicable to proposals relating to "(a) grant of approval of the Council for establishment of new technical institutions including Universities or University depart-ments and deemed Universities and for technical institutions function-ing on the date of commencement of these regulations at Degree and Diploma levels; (b) grant of approval of the Council for introduction of any course or programme in the technical institutions and technical departments or Universities or deemed Universities; (c) grant of approval of the Council for existing intake capacity of seats and for increase in the annual intake capacity of seats in courses and programmes.
The University statute 9(7) merely required that the 'views' of the State Government be obtained before granting affiliation and this did not amount to obtaining 'approval'.
The following points arise for consideration : (1) Whether in view of the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu & Another v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute & Others, [1995] 4 SCC 104 1995 Indlaw SC 1631, the provisions of the AICTE Act, 1987 occupied the field and it was not necessary to obtain the further approval of the Government or other authority? Whether any statute in the State of Kerala if it required such approval, would be void? (2) Whether the orders of rejection passed by the State Government were valid on merits and whether the University should have granted further orders to continue the affiliation solely on the basis of the AICTE permission? Point 1 : 9.   This point is more or less covered by the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu & Another v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute & Others,[l995] 4 SCC 104.
Point 2 : Factual position and pleadings in this case : 33.  On facts, the position was that the AICTE had granted approval on 30.4.95 expressly stating that this was "on consideration of the observations made by the Expert Committee and the recommendations made by the Central Regional Committee, State Level Committee, Central Task Force as per the provisions of AICTE Regulations dated 31.10.94".
