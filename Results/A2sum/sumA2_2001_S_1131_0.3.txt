The criminal reference and the criminal appeal were heard by a division bench of Rajasthan High Court.
On 4.4.1991, he was medically examined.
According to the medical opinion the probable cause of death of S was shock produced due to vaginal trauma and rupture of post- fornix along with asphyxia due to ligature around the neck.
The clothes were removed from the dead body and seized.
5.  The prosecution examined 21 witnesses in all.
There the accused had enquired from them as to what was the punishment awardable to an offender who was found to have been committed rape on a girl and killed her.
On seeing the case diary he stated that on 21.3.1991 the accused was definitely called twice on the same day though there is no mention of what enquiries were made from him.
From the evi-dence of Shalu, PW7 such an inference cannot be drawn.
During cross-examination, Kalu Ram stated that the accused was his neighbour, previously known to him.
15.  Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant has placed reliance on Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra, AIR (1981) SC 765 1980 Indlaw SC 47.
We have very carefully read the statement of this witness.
However, the accused was not detained and was sent back.
At 7.25 a.m. on 19.3.1991 first information report was lodged by BD at police station Kotputli.
Denial by an accused of an assertion made by his employer that the accused was on leave of absence from duty on the date of offence does not, by any stretch of reasoning or logic, amount to pleading alibi.
So far as the underwear is concerned, the investigation suffers from another infirmity also.
The proprietor of the cinema hall was examined to state that on 18th and 19th March the accused had taken leave from his job and during those days he was not present on duty.
Although the dead body of the victim was found on the outskirts of the village, however, there is no material available on record to fix the place and the likely time at which rape was committed on S and then she was murdered.
To constitute evidence of last seen together, the evidence must definitely permit an inference being drawn that the victim and the accused were seen together at a point of time in close proximity with the time and date of the commission of crime.
The plea taken should be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence, he could not have been present.
She stated that, accompanied by Phukla-another young girl, a cousin of hers, and S the deceased, she had gone to purchase balloon from the shop of Goma.
In the result, the High Court has declined the confirmation of death sentence but upheld the conviction on both the charges found proved and dismissed the appeal laying challenge to the conviction subject to modification in the sentence by substituting sentence of life impris- onment for death sentence under Section 302 IPC.
(i) Last seen together : On the point of last seen together there is solitary testimony of a child witness Shalu, PW7, aged about 4 years on 23.3.1992, the date of her examination in the court.
Harish Chand Sharma, PW21 stated that between 19th and 25th March, 1991 the accused Subhash was called at the police station several times for making enquiries.
The plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place.
The trial Court sentenced the appellant to death under Section 302 IPC and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs. 10,000, in default of payment to undergo further R.I. for 3 years, under Section 376(2)(f) IPC.
He was further asked to name the witness in whose statement Shalu's reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to Shalu was received by him.
The clothes on his person did not have any blood or seminal stains.
Without going into the question as to whether the statement of Kalu Ram, PW5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by Santosh PW9, let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence.
In the opinion of one learned Judge, the circumstantial evidence, on which rests the prosecution case, was not sufficient to record a finding of guilty against the appellant on any of the charges framed against him.
16.  In the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident.
Those circumstances should not be capable of being explained by any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused and the chain of the evidence must be so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the belief consistent with the innocence of the accused.
One of the circumstan-tial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of 'B' group was found on the accused's pant which blood group was also of the deceased.
Therein a charge under Sections 376 and 302  IPC  was sought to be substantiated on circumstanctial evidence.
(iii) Recovery of underwear stained with blood and semen Strangely enough the underwear and baniyan though discovered and seized, on an information given by the accused and on his pointing out apparently on a statement recorded under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, have not been produced and exhibited in the court.
The pieces of circumstantial evidence which have been found proved and held as forging an incriminating chain against the accused are as under :- (i) last seen together; (ii) abnormal conduct of the accused; (iii) recovery of underwear and baniyan (which was found to be stained with semen and blood group 'B' which is also the blood-group of the deceased); (iv) False plea of alibi; and (v) Accused absconding since the date of offence.
As regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's under-pant, the court observed that the accused was a grown-up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl.
(iv) False plea of alibi The High Court has gone completely amiss in holding that a plea of alibi was taken by the accused and that was found to be false.
Presence of semen stain on underwear, assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard, is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.
No evidence is available to show as to what was the blood group of the accused and therefore the possibility of blood on the underwear being of the accused himself cannot be and is not ruled out.
On 5.4.1991, at about 12.30 p.m., he gave an information Exbt.
The forensic science laboratory confirmed presence of Group-B blood on the clothes of deceased.
The accused has not stated during his statement under Section 313 Cr.
