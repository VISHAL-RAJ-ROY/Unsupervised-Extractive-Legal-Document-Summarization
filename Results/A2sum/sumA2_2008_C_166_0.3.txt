These words were not intended to bar a right of appeal.
Co. Ltd. v. Ram Tahel Ramnand (AIR 1972 SC 1598 1972 Indlaw SC 378)" It was noted as follows: "The non obstante clause in Rule 18, namely, "Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 1, 4 and 17 of this chapter", makes it abundantly clear why that rule uses the words "finally disposed of".
In addition, a bare reading of this Court's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous.
It takes us to the consideration of points arising for our decision on merits.
v. Commissioner of Hills Division [AIR 1958 SC 398 1958 Indlaw SC 62], T.C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa [AIR 1954 SC 440 1954 Indlaw SC 39] and Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra [AIR 2002 SC 1771 2002 Indlaw SC 1966], this Court held as follows: "From the aforesaid enunciation of law it is quite vivid and luminescent that the pleadings in the writ petition, nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge, character and the contour of the order, directions issued, nomenclature given the jurisdictional prospective in the Constitutional context are to be perceived.
We shall refer to the text of the order later.
The interim order passed by this Court shall continue for the aforesaid purpose.
Transport Society Ltd. (AIR 1961 Punj 24 1960 Indlaw PNH 196) and we are in agreement with it." 13.  The aforesaid decision squarely gets attracted on the facts of the present case.
It would not be an over emphasis to state that an order in a writ petition can fit into the subtle contour of articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution in a composite manner and they can coincide, co-exit, overlap imbricate.
In this context it is apt to note that there may be cases where the learned single judge may feel disposed or inclined to issue a writ to do full and complete justice because it is to be borne in mind that article 226 of the Constitutions is fundamentally a repository and reservoir of justice based on equity and good conscience.
To say that the words "finally disposed of" mean finally disposed of so far as the High Court is concerned is illogical because Rules 1, 4 and 7 use the words "be heard and disposed of by a Divisional Bench" and were the reasoning of the Full Bench correct, it would mean that so far as the High Court is concerned, when a Single Judge hears a matter and disposes it of, it is finally disposed of and when a Division Bench disposes it of, it is not finally disposed of.
Probably, this is the reason why it has become customary with the lawyers labelling their petitions as one common articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, though such practice has been deprecated in some judicial pronouncement.
v. Radhyshyam (Dr.) [AIR 1993 SC 806 1992 Indlaw SC 509] it was inter alia observed as follows: "The learned Single Judge in his impugned judgment dated December 11, 1987 nowhere mentioned that he was exercising the powers article 227 of the Constitution.
To elaborate; whether the learned Single Judge has exercised his jurisdiction article 226 or article 227 or both would depend upon various aspects and many a facet as has been emphasized in the afore quoted decisions of the apex Court.
In addition, the High Court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i.e. the discription given in the writ petition to be one article 227 of the Constitution.
It is because a Single Judge has no power under Rules 1, 4 and 17 to hear and dispose of a petition article 226 or 227 that the non obstante clause has been introduced in Rule 18.
Firstly, the writ of certiorari is an exercise of its original jurisdiction by the High Court; exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not an original jurisdiction and in this sense it is akin to appellate, revisional or corrective jurisdiction.
The use of the words "be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge" in Rule 18 merely clarifies the position that in such cases the power of the Single Judge is not confined merely to issuing a rule nisi.
Upon a review of decided cases and a survey of the occasions, wherein the High Courts have exercised jurisdiction to command a writ of certiorari or to exercise supervisory jurisdiction article 227 in the given facts and circumstances in a variety of cases, it seems that the distinction between the two jurisdictions stands almost obliterated in practice.
The cl. 15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges passed under revisional or supervisory powers.
As seen above, under Rules 1 and 17, applications articles 226 and 227 are required to be heard and disposed of by a Division Bench.
The appeal is allowed.
Lastly, the jurisdiction article 226 of the Constitution is capable of being exercised on a prayer made by or on behalf of the party aggrieved; the supervisory jurisdiction is capable of being exercised suo motu as well.
SCC 401 1986 Indlaw SC 651].
This conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned Single Judge in his judgment, as seen earlier.
