The conviction and sentence of appellants No. 1,2,3 and 5 for the offence under Section 3 TADA is also set aside but their conviction and sentence for the other offences as recorded by the Designated Court is upheld and to that extent their appeals fail.
The victims, it appears from the record, belong to the Wadar community.
The prosecution has not been able to establish the case against A-10 beyond a reasonable doubt and is our opinion he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
Baban Karpe PW-9, himself an injured witness, failed to identify A-10 at the time of the identification parade held by PW-32, though he identified A-10 later on in the Court during the trial.
From the testimony of PW9, it stands established that while Mukesh PW-12 was narrating the incident which had taken place at the video parlour, the appellants alongwith 7/8 other persons arrived in a jeep and two auto-rickshaws armed with swords, satturs and sticks and opened the assault on the prosecution witnesses and that A-11 and his two associates assaulted PW-14 with swords.
We find from a careful analysis of the evidence that the testimony of PW9 to PW-15 regarding the incident at the video parlour is cogent and trustworthy and nothing has been brought out during the cross-examination of these witnesses which may cast any doubt about the correctness of the version given by them regarding the incident at the video parlour.
At the trial, the prosecution alleged that the accused party with an intent to commit terror in the Wadar community had committed the murder of Popat and injured PW-9 and PW-14, by using lethal weapons and had thereby committed terror in the Wadar community and, thus, committed an offence under Section 3 of TADA, besides the other offences as already noticed.
Through this appeal under Section 19 of TADA, the appellants have called in question their conviction and sentence.
