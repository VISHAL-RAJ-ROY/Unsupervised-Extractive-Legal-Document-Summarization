(4) The Collector may appoint to each district as many persons as he thinks fit to be Circle Officers and Circle Inspectors to be in charge of a Circle, and one or more Talathis for a saza, and one or more Kotwals or other village servants for each village or group of villages, as he may deem fit.
P.C. was not permitted.
Subordination of officers.
Rejecting the submission this Court held:- "20.
Mr. Ahmadi, learned senior counsel further submitted that a request was made to the High Court not to enter into the merit of the case, and to confine itself to the question whether a second revision was at all maintainable, in the light of the ratio in Harishankar's case 1961 Indlaw SC 157 (supra), (1962) Suppl.(1) SCR 933 1961 Indlaw SC 157, Hiralal Kapur vs Prabhu Choudhury, (1988) 2 SCC 172 1988 Indlaw SC 342 and Helper Girdharbhai vs Saiyed Mohmad Mirasaheb Kadri and others, (1987) 3 SCC 538 1987 Indlaw SC 28281.
Sections 5, 6 and 7 reads as under:- "5.
Thereafter, Gulabai sold CTS No.133 admeasuring 33 Gunthas on 24.4.1977 to Respondent No.3 Genu Kadu.
It appears that these survey numbers were also given C.T.S.No.
Section 248 is also relevant which provides the forum of appeal to the State Government.
(2) A Tahsildar, a Naib-Tahsildar, and a District Inspector of Land Records may in the same manner call for and examine the proceedings of any officer subordinate to them in any matter in which neither a formal nor a summary inquiry has been held.
Section 11 of the Code is worth to be quoted herein below:- "11.
They were decided on 28.5.2001.
Appeal and appellate authorities.
The Schedule appended to the Code is as follows:- Schedule E (See section 247) 26.
Rules as to decisions or orders expressly made final Whenever in this Code, it is provided that a decision or order shall be final or conclusive, such provision shall mean that no appeal lies from any such decision or order; but it shall be lawful to the State Government alone to modify, annul or reverse any such decision or order under the provision of Section 257.
On the basis of the said sale certificate the mutation Entry No.1836 was effected in the village record in favour of Gulabai Desai, and thereby her name was entered in Survey Nos.118/1B and 328 of village Lonavala to the extent of 29.30 Ares and 70 Ares respectively.
Hence, the present appeal by special leave.
The facts in brief, as narrated in the impugned order, are that Survey Nos.118, 328 and 351 of Lonavala were originally owned by one Haji Habib Tar Mohammed Janu.
It is the appellant's case that his father Shri Nawoosingh Panjumal Panjwani was a displaced person who migrated from Pakistan to India during the period of partition and the appellant's family while in Pakistan was having agricultural land over there admeasuring 4 acres 10 gunthas.
Such Assistant or Deputy Collector may also be called a Sub-Divisional Officer.
The Survey Nos.118/2 and 351, being Evacuee Properties, were allotted to the Appellant in the year 1956.
After remand, the Sub Divisional Officer, conducted inquiry and again passed an order on 29.10.1987 and confirmed the earlier order.
Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, mainly attacked the revisional power exercised by the Minister concerned in purported exercise of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code.
Learned counsel submitted that the Commissioner or the Additional Commissioner is not equal in a rank but subordinate to the State Government.
Hence, even if one party goes to the Commissioner in revision, the State Government can still be approached under Section 257 for revision.
Thus, all the entries in favour of the Respondents were protected and maintained by the order of the State Minister for Revenue.
Referring the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Sambappa vs State of Maharashtra [(2002) SCC on line, Bombay 1222], learned counsel submitted that when the Sub-Divisional Officer, Additional Collector and Additional Commissioner had concurrently recorded finding in favour of the appellant by observing that the revenue record is not in consonance with the factual aspect and they have directed to correct the revenue entries, in such a case, the second revisional authority exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the said application and interfering with the finding of fact.
Collector, Pune dismissed the said appeals and confirmed the order of the Sub Divisional Officer, Maval.
In the present case, we noticed the scheme of the Code in the matters of hearing and disposal of appeals, revision and review.
It is, therefore, clear that in revenue matters the State Government is the Supreme Revenue Authority.
The said revision was decided by the Additional Commissioner, Pune by order dated 22.11.2001 and the said revision was dismissed.
The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has elaborately discussed the question and passed the impugned order holding that Section 257 confers jurisdiction to the State Government to entertain its revision against the order passed by any Revenue Officer either in appeal or in revision.
Both these RTS Appeals were heard by the Additional Collector, Pune and by order dated 28.5.2001 the Addl.
Learned counsel put heavy reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Ishwar Singh vs State of Rajasthan and others, (2005) 2 SCC 334 2005 Indlaw SC 6 for the proposition that there can be a second revision under the same provision of the Statute.
In other words, the State Government in exercise of its revisional as well as general power of superintendence and control can call for any record of proceedings and consider the legality and propriety of the orders passed by the Revenue officers under Section 247 or 257 of the Code.
It appears that in CTS No.129, 130-A, 130-B and 133, apart from vacant land there is a bungalow No.52- Habib Villa.
However, the Sub-Divisional Officer has taken the said mutation in revision in RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 and has set aside the mutation by order dated 30.7.1985.
The power of revision exercised by any Revenue officer including the Commissioner is a proceeding by a subordinate officer and the State Government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the Revenue officers.
It appears that the said order was taken in appeal by the respondent and the matter was remanded to the Sub Divisional Officer.
Now coming to the facts of the present case, the mutation Entry No.1836 was in fact certified.
Lastly, Mr. Ahmadi submitted that the second revision would not lie under Section 257 of the Revenue Code since Section 259 of the Code provides an opportunity to the State Government to only correct any "Final Order" while exercising power under the provisions of Section 257 i.e. with regard to its legality and propriety.
Sections 13 and 14 deal with the powers and duties of all Revenue Officers.
A fair reading of Sections 257 and 259 suggests that if revisional powers are exercised by a Revenue officer having jurisdiction to do so, further revisional power can be exercised by the superior officer or by the State Government.
(1) The State Government and any revenue of survey officer, not inferior in rank to an Assistant or Deputy Collector or a Superintendent of Land Records, in their respective departments, may call for and examine the record of any inquiry or the proceedings of any subordinate revenue or survey officer, for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself, as the case may be, as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed, and as to the regularity of the proceedings of such officer.
It is, therefore, not correct as contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the two authorities i.e. the State Government and the Registrar are interchangeable.
Respondent No.2 challenged this order of the Additional Commissioner by filing the proceeding RTS 3402/Pra.kra.309/L-6 by way of second revision before the Revenue Minister for State and the said proceeding was decided by the Minister for State on 18.10.2002.
It is further found that when the orders of the Collector directing to put the petitioner into possession were not obeyed by the subordinate Revenue Officers and the Revenue Officers effected the mutation entry No.2377 in favour of the Respondent Nos.3 Gulabai Desai and Mutation Entry No.2394 in favour of the Respondent No.5 Genu Kadu and thereafter for second time the special Divisional Officer, Maval, has exercised the revisional powers under Section 257 and initiated proceeding RTS Revision 12 of 1999 in respect of the mutation entry No.2377 and 2394.
Therefore, the RTS Appeal No.128 of 1987 was preferred before the Collector, which was disposed off by the Additional Collector on 13.7.1993.
The directions were issued by the Collector to the Tahsildar to place the appellant in possession of the property as per the orders of the Deputy Collector and the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties.
It will equally appear that when the orders were passed in Revision Application No.12 of 1999 before the Sub Divisional Officer in exercise of the powers under Section 257 the parties have preferred two RTS appeals in view of the provisions of Section 247 and 249 sub-section 2.
Revenue Officers in division.
The RTS Revision 12/99 was allowed on 28.1.2000 as against that two RTS appeals namely, RTS Appeal No.81 of 2000 and RTS Appeal No.114 of 2000 were preferred by the Respondent.
