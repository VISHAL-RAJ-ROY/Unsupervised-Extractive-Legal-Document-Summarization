1.  These two appeals involve identical questions and, therefore, are disposed of by this common judgment after noticing the factual position, so far as they are relevant.
If any concession has been given it can be withdrawn at any time and no time limit should be insisted upon before it was withdrawn.
The judgment forms subject matter of challenge in these appeals.
Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding, it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine.
letter to be valid, reversing the conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal.
v. Union of India, [1997] 3 SCC 398 1996 Indlaw SC 1561 it was observed that once public interest is accepted as the superior equity which can override individual equity the principle would be applicable even in cases where a period has been indicated for operation of the promise.
The High Court erroneously came to hold that the State Government had not filed any counter.
As noted above, the ultimate test is whether on the touchstone of reasonableness the policy decision comes out unscathed.
A basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so, does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness.
The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past practice.
It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on those issues on the facts of the present case.
Moreover, the Government is competent to rescind from the promise even if there is no manifest public interest involved, provided no one is put in any adverse situation which cannot be rectified.
If the party claiming application of the doctrine acted on the basis of a notification it should have known that such notification was liable to be amended or rescinded at any point of time, if the government felt that it was necessary to do so in public interest.
14.  In Hindustan Development Corporation's case1993 Indlaw SC 1085 (supra), it was observed that decision taken by the authority must be found to be arbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest where the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be applied.
We find no substance in the plea that before a policy decision is taken to amend or alter the promise indicated in any particular notification, the beneficiary was to be granted an opportunity of hearing.
If it is a question of policy, even by ways of change of old policy, the Courts cannot intervene with the decision.
The High Court has not dealt with the issue.
The State questioned correctness of the judgment before the High Court which, as noted above, held the G.O.Ms, and the Govt.
10.  A person may have a 'legitimate expectation' of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment.
(2) Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the Governor, and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor.
(1) The respondents have established their units prior to the Government orders granting the subsidy and they have no vested right to claim exemption.
(3) The respondents have not acted on the basis of the Government Orders for establishing the units.
In determining whether there is any unfairness involved the nature of the right alleged to have taken infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict, the reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question.
(4) The grant of subsidy is a concession and the Government has got good reasons for modifying the scheme in public interest.
" The decision-maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy.
Initially the writ petitions were filed before the High Court, but after constitution of the Tamil Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal') the writ petitions were transferred to the Tribunal which held that on application of the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation, the withdrawal of benefit was not sustainable in law.
Therein the court ruled that the principle stated in High Trees's case (supra), is that, where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word.
The materials which were produced before the High Court and on the basis of which it is decided that the decision of the Government is in order were not even pleaded in the pleadings and during arguments.
There was no material to show existence of any overriding public interest to rule out application of the aforesaid doctrine there was no scope for retrospective withdrawal.
The doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review.
But there has to be a word of caution.
If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power of violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well known grounds attracting Article 14 but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles.
30.  The appeals are disposed of accordingly without any order as to costs.
The contents of the files which were produced before the High Court and on which reliance was placed to hold against the appellants are not known to the appellants.
