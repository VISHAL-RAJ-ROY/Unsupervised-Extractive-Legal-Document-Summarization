35.  The Custodian in terms of the directions issued by the learned Special Court had affirmed an affidavit putting on record the assets and liabilities of each of the members of the so-called Harshad Mehta Group on an individual basis.
(xi) The learned Judge, Special Court shall take up the matter relating to confirmation of the auction sale in respect of the commercial properties immediately and pass an appropriate order thereupon within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
If in the meanwhile orders of assessment are passed by the Income Tax Authorities, the Custodian shall be at liberty to bring the same to the notice of the learned Special Court which shall also be taken into consideration by the learned Judge, Special Court.
The learned Judge, Special Court, in this behalf, having regard to the fact that several orders of Best Judgment Assessment have been passed by the Assessing Authority, may take into consideration the ratio laid down in the decision of this Court in Harshad Shantilal Mehta 1998 Indlaw SC 732 (supra).
The question as regard intermingling of accounts by the Appellants, herein with that of the Harshad Mehta Group and/ or any other or further contentions raised by the parties hereto before us shall receive due consideration of the learned Judge, Special Court afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore.
(ii) The Appellants being notified persons all their personal properties stood automatically attached and any other income from such attached properties would also stand attached.
CONCLUSION In view of our foregoing discussions, we are of the opinion that: (i) The contention of the Appellants that they being not involved in offences in transactions in securities could not have been proceeded in terms of the provisions of the Act cannot be accepted in view of the fact that they have been notified in terms thereof.
We, however, have not heard the purchasers as the question as to whether the auction sale of the said flats will be confirmed or not will depend upon the ultimate finding of the learned Judge, Special Court upon consideration of the matter afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore.
The liabilities of the Appellants, in view of our findings aforementioned, are required to be considered afresh by the learned Judge, Special Court.
Admittedly, the flats have been sold subject to the result of these appeals.
The flat belonging to the mother of Late Harshad Mehta has been released.
The learned Judge, Special Court, may, therefore, proceed to pass an appropriate order as regard confirmation of the sale of such properties.
" 44.  The said order, however, was modified and clarified by an order dated 5th May, 2004 that the same shall not apply to the sale of commercial properties in view of the order of the learned Judge, Special Court dated 17th October, 2003 wherein it was pointed out that the notified parties did not dispute the commercial properties being put to sale by the Custodian.
It is, furthermore, not in dispute that third party rights have since been created by reason of sale of a large number of commercial properties.
A chart has been annexed to the additional written submissions filed by Mr. Desai, which originated from a letter dated 9th December, 2005 issued by the Office of the Commissioner of Income Tax showing the current status of the liabilities of the individual members of the Harshad Mehta group in the following terms: "(I) Ashwin Mehta Rs. 1396 crores, (II) Deepika Mehta Rs. 120 crores (even after deducting the amount set aside by ITAT, it exceeds Rs. 63 crores).
If the orders of assessment have been set aside the liabilities of the Appellants have to be worked out on the basis of the new orders of assessment.
It had, however, never been the case of the Custodian that the examination of claims of all the notified parties is complete.
He has proceeded on the basis that even if the assets and liabilities of all individuals is taken on an individual basis, the liabilities would exceed assets in the case of each individual and corporate entity.
The Appellants have contended that the Custodian had taken contradictory or inconsistent stand inasmuch as the liabilities of all the entities were treated to be joint liabilities of Harshad Mehta group.
Furthermore, the question as regard liability of the parties should have been determined at the stage of Section 9-A of the Act.
A question may further arise as to whether the learned Judge was correct in considering the individual liabilities of the notified parties as the liabilities of the group.
The learned Judge merely accepted the figures mentioned in the affidavit of the Custodian and relied thereupon in the judgment without discussing the contentions and arguments raised on behalf of the Appellants, herein.
(v) Thus, taking into consideration the total of the decretal amount and the income-tax liability, it is clear that the total assets of Harshad Mehta group would be far below the liabilities.
28.  Several charts have been filed before us by the Appellants to show: (i) liabilities have been exaggerated by the Custodian.
LIFTING THE CORPORATE VEIL 26.  The principle of lifting the corporate veil, however, ipso facto would not apply to the individuals.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the provisions of the Limitation Act have no application, so far as directions required to be issued by the Special Court relating to the disposal of attached property, are concerned.
(iv) Whether the commercial properties could have been sold in auction.
(ii) Whether individual liabilities of the Appellants ought to have been separately considered by the Special Court as not a part of Harshad Mehta Group.
Neither the words "on and from the date of notification" nor the word 'property' lead to the conclusion that what is attached is not only that property which the notified person owned or was possessed of on the date of the notification but also all such property as he might acquire at any time thereafter.
Such attachment being automatic, no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the Appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities.
" ATTACHMENT OF PROPERTIES 17.  The Appellants herein are notified persons in terms of the provisions of the Act.
(2) of section 4 of the Act stating: "It is enough for the purpose of this appeal to hold that section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not apply to proceedings under section 4(2) of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992.
(ii) Sub-s.
The Special Court may in these cases, scale down the tax liability to be paid out of the funds in the hands of the Custodian.
This is because the tax liability of a notified person having priority under section 11(2)(a) is only tax liability pertaining to the "statutory period".
" In respect of the Question No. 3, it was opined that the date of distribution arrives when the Special Court completes the examination of claims under Section 9-A and if on that date, any tax liability for the statutory period is legally assessed, and the assessment is final and binding on a notified person, that liability would be considered for payment section 11(1)(a), subject to what follows.
Such tax liability may be discharged either under the directions of the Special Court under section 11(2)(c), or the taxing authority may recover the same from any subsequently acquired property of a notified person (vide Tejkumar Balakrishna Ruia v. A.K. Menon 1996 Indlaw SC 2403) or in any other manner from the notified person in accordance with law.
In other words, taxes as assessed which are presently payable by the notified person are taxes which have to be taken into account under section 11(2)(a) while distributing the property of the notified person.
At this stage the taxes "due" have to be actually paid out.
(a) of section 11(2)] refer only to taxes relating to a specific period or to all taxes due from the notified person? At what point of time should the taxes have become due? Does the Special Court have any discretion relating to the extent of payments to be made under section 11(2)(a) from out of the attached funds/property? Whether taxes include penalty or interest? Whether the Special Court has the power to absolve a notified person from payment of penalty or interest for a period subsequent to the date of his notification section 3.
section 9 provides for the procedure and powers of the Special Court.
