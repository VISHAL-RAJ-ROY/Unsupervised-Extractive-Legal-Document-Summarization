If merely what can be considered a part of the conditions of service of a workman is violated then we do not think there is any justification to hold that such activity will amount to public duty.
Writ petitioners were seeking for a writ of mandamus to put them back in the college and they were claiming only a terminal benefit or arrears of salary payable to them.
It was submitted that they do not discharge any public duty and hence the writ cannot be issued.
The appeal, therefore, stands dismissed subject to what is stated in regard to writs to be issued by the High Court in respect of persons or authorities exercising public duty or otherwise.
On that basis the learned Single Judge granted reliefs sought for by the respondents, however, imposing certain restrictions with regard to the age, being medically fit, on the date of the writ petition, had put in a minimum of three years of continuous service and such service prior to the attainment of the minimum qualifying age under the company should be ignored.
However, in the special features of the case, although we do not agree with the High Court on the first question raised, we feel, after clarifying the legal position, that we should not disturb the decision given by the High Court.
After detailed discussion, the learned authors have summarized the position with the following propositions: (1) The test of whether a body is performing a public function, and is hence amenable to judicial review, may not depend upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly a public or a private body.
The High Court dismissed the same stating that it is covered by another matter.
However, there is no material on record to show that the canteen is located in such an area where it would be hazardous to have a fire, furnace, source of heat or light to cook food.
The High Court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned Single Judge in T. Gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under Article 226 of the Constitution against a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person.
In such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter.
In these appeals, on a reference made on the question whether certain persons employed in the canteen should be treated as employees of the appellant and, if so, in what category they are to be fitted in and to what wages they are entitled to, the Industrial Tribunal, Hyderabad, [hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal] inquired into the matter.
That decision does not take note of the fact as to the nature of the functions that a person or an incorporated company should be performing to attract judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution.
In Anadi Muktas case this Court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty Article 226 of the Constitution can be invoked.
He, therefore, held that when a public duty is called upon to be discharged by a private management, a writ of mandamus would lie and could be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution.
The reference had been made to the Tribunal and adjudication had been made by the Tribunal as to the status of the workmen, the nature of employment, control exercised by the appellant, which leave no room for doubt that they are the employees of the appellant.
The canteen is provided in the factory premises of the appellant pursuant to Section 46 of the Factories Act, 1948 [hereinafter referred to as the Act], which obliges a factory employing more than 250 workmen to provide such a canteen.
(3) However, not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review.
This contention is also rejected.
On that basis, the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the writ appeal.
In the present case, the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.
In the present case, the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge on examination of the facts available is that there had been a canteen within the premises of the appellant up to the year 1982 and it is only from 1982 onwards the management of the canteen has been entrusted to a private contractor; that even after change of the contractor, the canteen workers have continued to be the same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time to time; that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen by the management through the contractor; that the appellant has provided the accommodation, furniture, fuel, electricity, utensils, etc.; that the management exercises control over the standard in quality, quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established.
The duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party, no matter by what means the duty is imposed.
However, noticing that the expression any person or authority used in Article 226 of the Constitution should not be confined only to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of State but would cover any other person or body performing public duty.
