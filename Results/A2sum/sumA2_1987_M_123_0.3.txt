Separate enquiry in this connection is going on in this office to know under what circumstances such entry has been made and copy also issued without knowledge of the Tahsildar.
We agree with his submission.
section 35 of the said Act deals with decision on claims and stipulates by sub-s.
In the meantime Abdul Khader filed an application on or about 21st of October, 1984 for adducing additional evidence to mark Kaulnama dated 2nd of December, 1950 for the first time and Oubuliatnama dated 2nd December, 1950 as exhibits in deciding the protected tenancy rights.
Thereafter there was an order appointing arbitrator on 29th of March, 1975 section 8(1)(b) of the Central Act.
section 8 deals with 'principles and method of determining compensation either for requisitioning or acquisition of the property and, inter alia, provides for appointment of an arbitrator in certain contingencies in case there was no agreement for determining compensation.
The learned Judge observed, inter alia, as follows: "I am told by the counsel for both the parties that the lands in question were already acquired for military purpose under the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable property Act, 1952 and that Sri M.S. Sharma, the Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad has already been appointed as Arbitrator under the Act for determining the compensation and the persons entitled to it.
We have heard the learned counsel for the respondents on the above question.
section 6 deals with the power of release from the requisitioning.
The High Court dealt with the value of the land.
The High Court shall decide the question of jurisdiction referred to above in light of the submissions to be made by both the parties.
If he was a tenant, the High Court observed.
Dr. Chitale learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court should be directed to consider the issues relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator appointed and functioning under the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 195 i to decide whether a person is protected tenant of an agricultural land or not in the light of Ss. 99 and 102 of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1950.
section 4 of the said Act empowers taking possession of requisitioned property.
The High Court thereafter discussed the facts mentioned hereinbefore about the order of the District Revenue Officer and the orders of this Court referred to hereinbefore.
Other C.M.Ps. were filed for clarification of the second part of the order dated 19th August, 1985 and this Court on 29th November, 1985 in CMPs.
He had claimed rights as a tenant during the requisition.
section 40 of the said Act makes rights of protected tenant heritable.
On or about 3rd February, 1970 the Collector issued notice for acquisition of the property section 7(1) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 being Act 30 of 1952 (hereinafter called the Central Act).
In this appeal we are concerned with the claim for compensation for the said acquisition by one Abdul Khader who was a flower picker.
section 39 deals with right of protected tenants to exchange lands.
In Civil Revision Petition No. 1006 of 1972 which was filed by Abdul Khader as against others, Justice R. Ramachandra Raju of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on or about 19th August, 1974 held that Abdul Khader was not a protected tenant and directed deletion of entry made in the Final Record of tenancies as a spurious one.
The property in question was taken possession of on or about 12th of September, 1963.
In 1954, there was Wakfnama by the said Sail Nawaz Jung.
It is necessary also to note the provisions of section 99 of the Act.
In the appeal of Abdul Khader the proceedings of Revenue Divisional Officer while questioning entry of the name of Abdul Khader in the Register is a genuine one or net and while it is stated that it was entered in the Register in such suspicious way by giving Serial No. 1/A between Serial Nos. 1 and 2 of Register being Exhibit A. 106 and Exhibit A. 107, it ultimately held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant under section 37A of the Andhra Pradesh Act.
It has to be borne in mind that in the award, the arbitrator after exhaustively discussing the evidence on record held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant and as such further held that he was entitled to 60% of the compensation money payable for the acquisition of the land excluding the land of buildings, wells etc.
In this appeal we are concerned with the question whether the High Court was right in upholding the award of the arbitrator so far as it has held in favour of Abdul Khader and his rights to get 60% of the compensation.
(4) of section 40 stipulates that the interest of a protected tenant in the land held by him as a protected tenant shall form sixty per cent.
The judgment also dealt with the question as to who were the successors of Nawaz Jung.
Not only that, in the writ petition filed by the present petitioner in this Court, it was held that it is not necessary to go into the question whether the petitioner is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the property because they are the matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under section 8 of the Act.
(ii) of cl.
This appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated 15th April, 1986.
section 2(r) states that the expression 'protected' means a person who is deemed to be a protected tenant under the provisions of the said Act.
section 36 of the said Act deals with the recovery of possession by protected tenant.
(1) of section 35 of the said Act that if any question arises whether any person, and if so what person, is deemed under section 34 to be a protected tenant in respect of any land, the landholder, or any person claiming to be so deemed, may, within one year from the commencement of the Act apply in the prescribed form to the Tahsildar for the decision of the question and the Tahsildar shall after enquiring into the claim or claims in the manner prescribed, declare what person is entitled to be deemed to be protected tenant or as the case may be, that no person is so entitled.
The High Court was of the view that the arbitrator was to decide that question and the arbitrator was not in error in deciding the issue in the manner it did.
According to the High Court the documents discussed in the judgment indicated that Shaik Hussain was a tenant from 1935.
Bar of Jurisdiction:-(1) Save as provided in this Act no Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to settle, decide or deal with any question which is by or under this Act required to be settled, decided or dealt with by the Tahsildar, Tribunal or Collector or by the Board of Revenue or Government.
The High Court noticed the position that under the said Andhra Pradesh Act it was for the revenue authorities to order whether a tenant is a protected tenant under section 34, section 37 'and section 37A of the said Act.
In this background the Court addressed itself to the question whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant or not entitled to 60% of the compensation.
The High Court also referred to the directions of this Court dated 19th August, 1985 mentioned hereinbefore.
Shri Subba Rao, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the appellants should not be permitted to withdraw from the authorities concerned more than 40 per cent of the total compensation awarded in respect of the lands in question pending disposal of the appeal before the High Court.
No document was filed to show that Abdul Khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant.
The explanation to sub- section (3) of section 40 of the said Act provides who should be 'deemed to be the heirs' of a protected tenant.
(2) of section 34 of the said Act also deals with "to be deemed to be a protected tenant in respect of any land", for certain purposes.
There was an award by the arbitrator holding that as this Court had left it open to decide whether Abdul Khader was a protected tenant.
Despite the objection exercising the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to go into the question of protected tenant, the arbitrator held that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant.
After his death Mohd. Abdul Khader was recognised as the tenant.
